# Gastown Convoy System

The convoy system tracks batches of work across rigs. A convoy is a bead that `tracks` other beads via dependencies. The daemon monitors close events and feeds the next ready issue when one completes.

+==============================+
```

Three creation paths (sling, create, stage), two feed paths, same safety guards:
- **Event-driven** (`operations.go`): Polls beads stores every ~5s for close events. Calls `feedNextReadyIssue` which checks `IsSlingableType` + `isIssueBlocked` before dispatch. **Skips staged convoys** (`isConvoyStaged` check).
- **Stranded scan** (`convoy_manager.go`): Runs every 30s. `feedFirstReady` iterates all ready issues. The ready list is pre-filtered by `IsSlingableType` in `findStrandedConvoys` (cmd/convoy.go). **Only sees open convoys** — staged convoys never appear.

## Safety guards (the three rules)

These prevent the event-driven feeder from dispatching work it shouldn't:

### 1. Type filtering (`IsSlingableType`)

Only leaf work items dispatch. Defined in `operations.go`:

```go
var slingableTypes = map[string]bool{
    "task": true, "bug": true, "feature": true, "chore": true,
    "": true, // empty defaults to task
}
```

Epics, sub-epics, convoys, decisions -- all skip. Applied in both `feedNextReadyIssue` (event path) and `findStrandedConvoys` (stranded path).

### 2. Blocks dep checking (`isIssueBlocked`)

Issues with unclosed `blocks`, `conditional-blocks`, or `waits-for` dependencies skip. `parent-child` is **not** blocking -- a child task dispatches even if its parent epic is open. This is consistent with `bd ready` and molecule step behavior.

Fail-open on store errors (assumes not blocked) to avoid stalling convoys on transient Dolt issues.

### 3. Dispatch failure iteration

Both feed paths iterate past failures instead of giving up:
- `feedNextReadyIssue`: `continue` on dispatch failure, try next ready issue
- `feedFirstReady`: `for range ReadyIssues` with `continue` on skip/failure, `return` on first success

## CLI commands

### Stage and launch (validated creation)

```bash
gt convoy stage <epic-id>            # analyze deps, build DAG, compute waves, create staged convoy
gt convoy stage gt-task1 gt-task2    # stage from explicit task list
gt convoy stage hq-cv-abc            # re-stage existing staged convoy
gt convoy stage <epic-id> --json     # machine-readable output
gt convoy stage <epic-id> --launch   # stage + immediately launch if no errors
gt convoy launch hq-cv-abc           # transition staged → open, dispatch Wave 1
gt convoy launch <epic-id>           # stage + launch in one step (delegates to stage --launch)
```

### Create and manage

```bash
gt convoy create "Auth overhaul" gt-task1 gt-task2 gt-task3
gt convoy add hq-cv-abc gt-task4
```

### Check and monitor

```bash
gt convoy check hq-cv-abc       # auto-closes if all tracked issues done
gt convoy check                  # check all open convoys
gt convoy status hq-cv-abc       # single convoy detail
gt convoy list                   # all convoys
gt convoy list --all             # include closed
```

### Find stranded work

```bash
gt convoy stranded               # ready work with no active workers
gt convoy stranded --json        # machine-readable
```

### Close and land

```bash
gt convoy close hq-cv-abc --reason "done"
gt convoy land hq-cv-abc         # cleanup worktrees + close
```

### Interactive TUI

```bash
gt convoy -i                     # opens interactive convoy browser
gt convoy --interactive          # long form
```

## Batch sling behavior

`gt sling <bead1> <bead2> <bead3>` creates **one convoy** tracking all beads. The rig is auto-resolved from the beads' prefixes (via `routes.jsonl`). The convoy title is `"Batch: N beads to <rig>"`. Each bead gets its own polecat, but they share a single convoy for tracking.

The convoy ID and merge strategy are stored on each bead, so `gt done` can find the convoy via the fast path (`getConvoyInfoFromIssue`).

### Rig resolution

- **Auto-resolve (preferred):** `gt sling gt-task1 gt-task2 gt-task3` -- resolves rig from the `gt-` prefix. All beads must resolve to the same rig.
- **Explicit rig (deprecated):** `gt sling gt-task1 gt-task2 gt-task3 myrig` -- still works, prints a deprecation warning. If any bead's prefix doesn't match the explicit rig, errors with suggested actions.
- **Mixed prefixes:** If beads resolve to different rigs, errors listing each bead's resolved rig and suggested actions (sling separately, or `--force`).
- **Unmapped prefix:** If a prefix has no route, errors with diagnostic info (`cat .beads/routes.jsonl | grep <prefix>`).

### Conflict handling

If any bead is already tracked by another convoy, batch sling **errors** with detailed conflict info (which convoy, all beads in it with statuses, and 4 recommended actions). This prevents accidental double-tracking.

```bash
# Auto-resolve: one convoy, three polecats (preferred)
gt sling gt-task1 gt-task2 gt-task3
# -> Created convoy hq-cv-xxxxx tracking 3 beads

# Explicit rig still works but prints deprecation warning
gt sling gt-task1 gt-task2 gt-task3 gastown
# -> Deprecation: gt sling now auto-resolves the rig from bead prefixes.
# -> Created convoy hq-cv-xxxxx tracking 3 beads
```

## Stage-launch workflow

> Implemented in [PR #1820](https://github.com/steveyegge/gastown/pull/1820). Depends on the feeder safety guards from [PR #1759](https://github.com/steveyegge/gastown/pull/1759). Design docs: `docs/design/convoy/stage-launch/prd.md`, `docs/design/convoy/stage-launch/testing.md`.

The stage-launch workflow is a two-phase convoy creation path that validates dependencies and computes wave dispatch order **before** any work is dispatched. This is the preferred path for epic delivery.

### Input types

`gt convoy stage` accepts three mutually exclusive input types:

| Input | Example | Behavior |
|-------|---------|----------|
| Epic ID | `gt convoy stage bcc-nxk2o` | BFS walks entire parent-child tree, collects all descendants |
| Task list | `gt convoy stage gt-t1 gt-t2 gt-t3` | Analyzes exactly those tasks |
| Convoy ID | `gt convoy stage hq-cv-abc` | Re-reads tracked beads from existing staged convoy (re-stage) |

Mixed types (e.g., epic + task together) error. Multiple epics or multiple convoys error.

### Processing pipeline

```
1. validateStageArgs     — reject empty/flag-like args
2. bdShow each arg       — resolve bead types
3. resolveInputKind      — classify Epic / Tasks / Convoy
4. collectBeads          — gather BeadInfo + DepInfo (BFS for epic, direct for tasks)
5. buildConvoyDAG        — construct in-memory DAG (nodes + edges)
6. detectErrors          — cycle detection + missing rig checks
7. detectWarnings        — orphans, parked rigs, cross-rig, capacity, missing branches
8. categorizeFindings    — split into errors / warnings
9. chooseStatus          — staged:ready, staged:warnings, or abort on errors
10. computeWaves         — Kahn's algorithm (only when no errors)
11. renderDAGTree        — print ASCII dependency tree
12. renderWaveTable      — print wave dispatch plan
13. createStagedConvoy   — bd create --type=convoy --status=<staged-status>
```

### Wave computation (Kahn's algorithm)

Only slingable types participate in waves: `task`, `bug`, `feature`, `chore`. Epics are excluded.

Execution edges (create wave ordering):
- `blocks`
- `conditional-blocks`
- `waits-for`

Non-execution edges (ignored for wave ordering):
- `parent-child` — hierarchy only
- `related`, `tracks`, `discovered-from`

**Algorithm:**
1. Filter to slingable nodes only
2. Calculate in-degree for each node (count BlockedBy edges to other slingable nodes)
3. Peel loop: collect all nodes with in-degree 0 → Wave N; remove them; decrement neighbors; repeat
4. Sort within each wave alphabetically for determinism

Output example:
```
  Wave   ID              Title                     Rig       Blocked By
  ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  1      bcc-nxk2o.1.1   Init scaffolding          bcc       —
  2      bcc-nxk2o.1.2   Shared types              bcc       bcc-nxk2o.1.1
  3      bcc-nxk2o.1.3   CLI wrapper               bcc       bcc-nxk2o.1.2

  3 tasks across 3 waves (max parallelism: 1 in wave 1)
```

### Convoy status model

Four statuses with defined transitions:

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `staged:ready` | Validated, no errors or warnings, ready to launch |
| `staged:warnings` | Validated, no errors but has warnings. Fix and re-stage, or launch anyway. |
| `open` | Active — daemon feeds work as beads close |
| `closed` | Complete or cancelled |

Valid transitions:

| From → To | Allowed? |
|-----------|----------|
| `staged:ready` → `open` | Yes (launch) |
| `staged:warnings` → `open` | Yes (launch) |
| `staged:*` → `closed` | Yes (cancel) |
| `staged:ready` ↔ `staged:warnings` | Yes (re-stage) |
| `open` → `closed` | Yes |
| `closed` → `open` | Yes (reopen) |
| `open` → `staged:*` | **No** |
| `closed` → `staged:*` | **No** |

### Error vs warning classification

**Errors** (fatal — prevent convoy creation):

| Category | Trigger | Fix |
|----------|---------|-----|
| `cycle` | Cycle detected in execution edges | Remove one blocking dep in the cycle |
| `no-rig` | Slingable bead has no rig (prefix not in routes.jsonl) | Add routes.jsonl entry |

**Warnings** (non-fatal — convoy created as `staged:warnings`):

| Category | Trigger |
|----------|---------|
| `orphan` | Slingable task with no blocking deps in either direction (epic input only) |
| `blocked-rig` | Bead targets a parked or docked rig |
| `cross-rig` | Bead on a different rig than the majority |
| `capacity` | A wave has more than 5 tasks |
| `missing-branch` | Sub-epic with children but no integration branch |

### Launch behavior

`gt convoy launch <convoy-id>` transitions a staged convoy to open and dispatches Wave 1:

1. Validate convoy exists and is staged
2. Transition status to `open`
3. Re-read tracked beads, rebuild DAG, recompute waves
5. Dispatch every task in Wave 1 via `gt sling <beadID> <rig>`
6. Individual sling failures do NOT abort remaining dispatches
7. Print dispatch results (checkmark/X per task)
8. Subsequent waves handled automatically by the daemon

If `gt convoy launch` receives an epic or task list (not a staged convoy), it delegates to `gt convoy stage --launch` to stage-then-launch in one step.

### Staged convoy daemon safety

**Staged convoys are completely inert to the daemon.** Neither feed path processes them:

- **Event-driven feeder:** `isConvoyStaged` check in `CheckConvoysForIssue` skips any convoy with `staged:*` status. Fail-open on read errors (assumes not staged → processes, which is safe since a read error on a non-existent convoy does nothing).
- **Stranded scan:** `gt convoy stranded` only returns open convoys. Staged convoys never appear.

This means you can stage a convoy, review the wave plan, and launch when ready — no risk of premature dispatch.

### Re-staging

Running `gt convoy stage <convoy-id>` on an existing staged convoy re-analyzes and updates:
- Re-reads tracked beads from the convoy's `tracks` deps
- Rebuilds DAG, re-detects errors/warnings, recomputes waves
- Updates status via `bd update` (e.g., `staged:warnings` → `staged:ready` if warnings resolved)
- Does NOT create a new convoy or re-add track dependencies

## Testing convoy changes

### Running tests

```bash
# Full convoy suite (all packages)
go test ./internal/convoy/... ./internal/daemon/... ./internal/cmd/... -count=1

# By area:
go test ./internal/convoy/... -v -count=1                       # feeding logic
go test ./internal/daemon/... -v -count=1 -run TestConvoy       # ConvoyManager
go test ./internal/daemon/... -v -count=1 -run TestFeedFirstReady
go test ./internal/cmd/... -v -count=1 -run TestCreateBatchConvoy  # batch sling
go test ./internal/cmd/... -v -count=1 -run TestBatchSling
go test ./internal/cmd/... -v -count=1 -run TestResolveRig      # rig resolution
go test ./internal/daemon/... -v -count=1 -run Integration      # real beads stores

# Stage-launch:
go test ./internal/cmd/... -v -count=1 -run TestConvoyStage     # staging logic
go test ./internal/cmd/... -v -count=1 -run TestConvoyLaunch    # launch + Wave 1 dispatch
go test ./internal/cmd/... -v -count=1 -run TestDetectCycles    # cycle detection
go test ./internal/cmd/... -v -count=1 -run TestComputeWaves    # wave computation
go test ./internal/cmd/... -v -count=1 -run TestBuildConvoyDAG  # DAG construction
```

### Key test invariants

- `feedFirstReady` dispatches exactly 1 issue per call (first success wins)
- `feedFirstReady` iterates past failures (sling exit 1 -> try next)
- Parked rigs are skipped in both event poll and feedFirstReady
- hq store is never skipped even if `isRigParked` returns true for everything
- High-water marks prevent event reprocessing across poll cycles
- First poll cycle is warm-up only (seeds marks, no processing)
- `IsSlingableType("epic") == false`, `IsSlingableType("task") == true`, `IsSlingableType("") == true`
- `isIssueBlocked` is fail-open (store error -> not blocked)
- `parent-child` deps are NOT blocking
- Batch sling creates exactly 1 convoy for N beads (not N convoys)
- `resolveRigFromBeadIDs` errors on mixed prefixes, unmapped prefixes, town-level prefixes
- Cycles in blocking deps prevent staged convoy creation (exit non-zero, no side effects)
- Wave 1 contains ONLY tasks with zero unsatisfied blocking deps among slingable nodes
- Epics and non-slingable types are NEVER placed in waves
- Daemon does NOT feed issues from `staged:*` convoys (both feed paths skip)
- `staged:warnings` convoys can still be launched (warnings are informational)
- Re-staging a convoy does NOT create duplicates (updates in place)
- Launch dispatches ONLY Wave 1, not subsequent waves
- Wave computation is deterministic (same input → same output, alphabetical sort within waves)

### Deeper test engineering

See `docs/design/convoy/stage-launch/testing.md` for the full stage-launch test plan (105 tests across unit, integration, snapshot, and property tiers).

See `docs/design/convoy/testing.md` for the general convoy test plan covering failure modes, coverage gaps, harness scorecard, test matrix, and recommended test strategy.

## Common pitfalls

- **`parent-child` is never blocking.** This is a deliberate design choice, not a bug. Consistent with `bd ready`, beads SDK, and molecule step behavior.
- **Batch sling errors on already-tracked beads.** If any bead is already in a convoy, the entire batch sling fails with conflict details. The user must resolve the conflict before proceeding.
- **The stranded scan has its own blocked check.** `isReadyIssue` in cmd/convoy.go reads `t.Blocked` from issue details. `isIssueBlocked` in operations.go covers the event-driven path. Don't consolidate them without understanding both paths.
- **Empty IssueType is slingable.** Beads default to type "task" when IssueType is unset. Treating empty as non-slingable would break all legacy beads.
- **`isIssueBlocked` is fail-open.** Store errors assume not blocked. A transient Dolt error should not permanently stall a convoy -- the next feed cycle retries with fresh state.
- **Explicit rig in batch sling is deprecated.** `gt sling beads... rig` still works but prints a warning. Prefer `gt sling beads...` with auto-resolution.
- **Staged convoys are inert.** The daemon ignores them completely. Don't expect auto-feeding until you `gt convoy launch`.
- **Review `staged:warnings` before launching.** Warnings are informational — fix and re-stage if possible, or launch anyway if they're acceptable.
- **`gt convoy launch` on a non-staged input delegates to stage.** If you pass an epic or task list to `launch`, it runs `stage --launch` internally. Only an already-staged convoy gets the fast path.
- **Wave computation is informational.** Waves are computed at stage time for display. Runtime dispatch uses the daemon's per-cycle `isIssueBlocked` checks, which are more dynamic.
- **You cannot un-stage an open convoy.** Once launched, a convoy cannot return to staged status. The `open → staged:*` transition is rejected.
