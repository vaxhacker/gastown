Recover work and land a durable fix when safe.\ndispatched_by: mayor\n\n## Incident\nSeveral gastown polecats are marked `done` with closed beads, but their work did not merge to `origin/main`.\n\n## Confirmed scope\nAffected issues:\n- gt-osl2\n- gt-hp4p\n- gt-bhew\n- gt-yso9\n- gt-48eq\n- gt-fnqq\n- gt-gyhj\n\nAffected branches:\n- polecat/capable/gt-osl2@mly6f2kg\n- polecat/dementus/gt-hp4p@mly6dpff\n- polecat/rictus/gt-bhew@mly6bj9i\n- polecat/toast/gt-yso9@mly6gfda\n- polecat/nux/gt-48eq@mly8kz3w\n- polecat/dag/gt-fnqq@mly8ljqu\n- polecat/cheedo/gt-gyhj@mly8m4f2\n\n## Observed facts\n1. `gt mq list gastown` is empty.\n2. `bd list --rig gastown --type=merge-request` returns no MR beads.\n3. `WORK_DONE` mails from real polecats include errors like:\n   - \"push appeared to succeed but branch 'polecat/...@...' not found on remote\"\n4. `gt done` can take an early `goto notifyWitness` path before MR creation when push verification fails.\n   - See `internal/cmd/done.go` around lines ~595-615 and MR creation later around ~761.\n5. Branches DO exist on `origin` and are ahead of `origin/main` by 1 commit each.\n6. Witness inbox has high duplicate `WORK_DONE/POLECAT_DONE` churn (including duplicate senders like `alpha`/`Toast`).\n\n## Why this matters\nBeads got closed and polecats exited, but work did not enter merge queue, so changes are stranded on feature branches.\n\n## Required outcomes\n1. Recover all stranded work safely into main (through intended merge flow when possible).\n2. Fix/mitigate root cause so future `gt done` runs do not false-fail remote branch verification.\n3. Reduce duplicate completion signal spam if it contributes to lifecycle confusion.\n\n## Guidance for assignee\n- Treat this as both incident response and bug fix.\n- Prioritize preserving/landing user-facing changes first.\n- If recovery is straightforward and safe, you may push the fixes/landings directly.\n- If there is ambiguity or risk (history rewrite, unexpected branch state, conflicting cleanup paths), notify mayor immediately with a concise decision request.\n\n## Suggested technical approach\n- Recovery path:\n  - Verify each listed origin branch tip and diff against `origin/main`.\n  - Submit proper MQ entries (or equivalent safe landing path) for each, ensuring refinery can process.\n  - Confirm landed commits in `origin/main` and close the convoy/incident state appropriately.\n- Root cause path:\n  - Reproduce the false \"branch not found on remote\" path in `gt done`.\n  - Inspect push verification logic in `internal/cmd/done.go` and any git remote visibility edge cases.\n  - Add regression tests to prevent this class of false negative.\n- Comms:\n  - Send status to mayor at key checkpoints (recovery started, first landing verified, fix merged, residual risk).\n\n## Useful evidence already collected\n- `gt mail read` on WORK_DONE IDs shows explicit error text and exit type.\n- `git rev-list --left-right --count origin/main...origin/\u003cbranch\u003e` shows `0 1` for each affected branch.\n- `gt mq list gastown` and MR bead list are empty.","design":"","due_at":null,"ephemeral":0,"estimated_minutes":null,"event_kind":"","external_ref":null,"hook_bead":"","id":"gt-aizp","is_template":0,"issue_type":"bug","last_activity":null,"metadata":"{}","mol_type":"","notes":"","original_size":null,"owner":"shane.werner@gmail.com","payload":"","pinned":0,"priority":1,"quality_score":null,"rig":"","role_bead":"","role_type":"","sender":"","source_repo":"","source_system":"","spec_id":"","status":"closed","target":"","timeout_ns":0,"title":"Incident: done polecats closed beads but skipped MR merge flow","updated_at":"2026-02-22T21:39:24Z","waiters":"","wisp_type":"","work_type":""}

Consider waking it or escalating.\n\n**Step 3: Check deacon health**\n\n⚠️ **The deacon tmux session is named `hq-deacon`** (NOT `deacon`).\nTown-level agents use the `hq-` prefix.\n\n```bash\ntmux has-session -t hq-deacon 2\u003e/dev/null \u0026\u0026 echo \"alive\" || echo \"dead\"\n```\n\nIf the deacon session is dead, escalate to Mayor:\n```bash\ngt mail send mayor/ -s \"ALERT: Deacon session hq-deacon is down\" \\\n  -m \"Deacon tmux session (hq-deacon) not found.\nDetected during witness patrol.\nPlease restart the deacon.\"\n```\n\n**Step 4: Escalate if needed**\n\nIf you identify problems, escalate to Deacon with specific MR IDs and context:\n```bash\ngt mail send deacon/ -s \"QUEUE_HEALTH: \u003csummary\u003e\" \\\n  -m \"MR IDs: \u003cids\u003e\nObservation: \u003cwhat you found\u003e\nRecommendation: \u003cwhat should happen\u003e\"\n```","design":"","due_at":null,"ephemeral":0,"estimated_minutes":null,"event_kind":"","external_ref":null,"hook_bead":"","id":"gt-mol-00t13","is_template":0,"issue_type":"task","last_activity":null,"metadata":"{}","mol_type":"","notes":"","original_size":null,"owner":"","payload":"","pinned":0,"priority":2,"quality_score":null,"rig":"","role_bead":"","role_type":"","sender":"","source_repo":"","source_system":"","spec_id":"","status":"closed","target":"","timeout_ns":0,"title":"Check refinery and deacon health","updated_at":"2026-02-22T10:51:18Z","waiters":"","wisp_type":"","work_type":""}

A polecat with agent_state=running\nor hook_bead assigned but NO tmux session is a zombie that will sit forever\nundetected unless you proactively check.\n\nFor EVERY polecat with agent_state=running/working OR hook_bead assigned:\n```bash\ngt session status \u003crig\u003e/\u003cname\u003e --json | jq -r '.running' | grep -q true \u0026\u0026 echo ALIVE || echo ZOMBIE\n```\n\n**If ZOMBIE detected** (session missing, agent says working):\n\n1. Check git state to determine if work is recoverable:\n```bash\ncd polecats/\u003cname\u003e/\u003crig\u003e\ngit status --porcelain         # Uncommitted changes?\ngit log @{u}..HEAD      # Unpushed commits?\n```\n\n2. **If clean** (no uncommitted, no unpushed): Auto-nuke immediately.\n```bash\ngt polecat nuke \u003cname\u003e\n```\n\n3. **If dirty** (has unpushed/uncommitted work): Escalate to Deacon for recovery.\n```bash\ngt mail send deacon/ -s \"RECOVERY_NEEDED \u003crig\u003e/\u003cname\u003e\" \\\n  -m \"Polecat: \u003crig\u003e/\u003cname\u003e\nCleanup Status: \u003chas_uncommitted|has_unpushed|has_stash\u003e\nHook Bead: \u003chook_bead\u003e\nDetected: $(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)\n\nZombie detected: tmux session dead, agent_state=\u003cstate\u003e.\nThis polecat has unpushed/uncommitted work that will be lost if nuked.\nPlease coordinate recovery before authorizing cleanup.\"\n```\n\nAlso create a cleanup wisp for tracking:\n```bash\nbd create --ephemeral --title \"cleanup:\u003cname\u003e\" \\\n  --description \"Zombie detected: session dead, state=\u003cagent_state\u003e\" \\\n  --labels cleanup,polecat:\u003cname\u003e,state:zombie-detected\n```\n\n**Step 3: For running polecats (with LIVE session), assess progress**\n\nCheck the hook_bead field to see what they're working on:\n```bash\nbd show \u003chook_bead\u003e  # See current step/issue\n```\n\nYou can also verify they're responsive:\n```bash\ngt peek \u003crig\u003e/\u003cname\u003e 20\n```\n\nLook for:\n- Recent tool activity → making progress\n- Idle at prompt → may need nudge\n- Error messages → may need help\n\n**Step 3a: For idle polecats, auto-nuke if clean**\n\nWhen agent_state=idle, the polecat has no work assigned. Check if it's safe to nuke:\n\n```bash\n# Check git status in the polecat's worktree\ncd polecats/\u003cname\u003e\ngit status --porcelain         # Should be empty (clean)\ngit log @{u}..HEAD      # Should have no unpushed commits\n```\n\n**If clean** (no uncommitted changes, no unpushed commits):\n```bash\n# Safe to nuke - no work to lose\ngt polecat nuke \u003cname\u003e\n```\nLog the auto-nuke for audit purposes. No escalation needed.\n\n**If dirty** (uncommitted or unpushed work):\n```bash\n# Escalate to Deacon - polecat has work that might be valuable\ngt mail send deacon/ -s \\\"IDLE_DIRTY: \u003cpolecat\u003e has uncommitted work\\\" \\\n  -m \\\"Polecat: \u003cname\u003e\nState: idle (no hook_bead)\nGit status: \u003cuncommitted-files\u003e\nUnpushed commits: \u003ccount\u003e\n\nPlease advise: recover work or discard?\\\"\n```\n\n**Rationale**: Idle polecats with clean git state are pure overhead. They have\nno work and no state worth preserving. Nuking them immediately frees resources\nand reduces noise. Only escalate when there's actual work at risk.\n\n**Step 4: Decide action**\n\n| Observation | Action |\n|-------------|--------|\n| agent_state=running, session alive, recent activity | None |\n| agent_state=running, session alive, idle 5-15 min | Gentle nudge |\n| agent_state=running, session alive, idle 15+ min | Direct nudge with deadline |\n| agent_state=running, SESSION DEAD | ZOMBIE — handle in Step 2a |\n| agent_state=stuck | Assess and help or escalate |\n| agent_state=done | Verify cleanup triggered (see Step 4a) |\n\n**Step 4a: Handle agent_state=done**\n\nIn the ephemeral model, polecats with agent_state=done and cleanup_status=clean\nshould already be nuked by HandlePolecatDone. Finding one here indicates:\n\n1. **Stale agent bead** - polecat was nuked but bead remains\n   ```bash\n   # Verify polecat doesn't exist anymore\n   ls polecats/\u003cname\u003e 2\u003e/dev/null || echo \"Already nuked\"\n   ```\n   If nuked, the agent bead is stale. Clean it up or ignore.\n\n2. **Cleanup wisp exists** - polecat has dirty state needing intervention\n   ```bash\n   bd list --label polecat:\u003cname\u003e --status=open\n   ```\n   Process in process-cleanups step.\n\n3. **No wisp, polecat exists** - POLECAT_DONE mail was missed\n   Try auto-nuke directly (ephemeral model):\n   ```bash\n   # Check cleanup_status and nuke if clean\n   gt polecat nuke \u003cname\u003e  # Will fail if dirty\n   ```\n   If nuke fails (dirty state), create cleanup wisp for investigation.\n\n**Step 5: Execute nudges**\n```bash\n# Use --mode=queue to avoid interrupting in-flight tool calls\ngt nudge --mode=queue \u003crig\u003e/polecats/\u003cname\u003e \"How's progress? Need help?\"\n```\n\n**Step 6: Escalate if needed**\n```bash\ngt mail send deacon/ -s \"Escalation: \u003cpolecat\u003e stuck\" \\\n  -m \"Polecat \u003cname\u003e reports stuck. Please intervene.\"\n```\n\n**Parallelism**: Use Task tool subagents to inspect multiple polecats concurrently.\n\n**ZFC Principle**: Trust agent_state from beads for WHAT agents report. But\nverify tmux session existence for WHETHER agents are alive. A dead session with\nagent_state=running is a zombie — the agent cannot correct its own state.\n\n**Step 7: ORPHANED BEAD DETECTION — Scan from beads side**\n\n🚨 **CRITICAL**: Zombie detection (Step 2a) scans FROM polecat directories.\nOnce a polecat is nuked and its directory removed, its beads become invisible\nto zombie detection. Orphaned bead detection scans FROM beads to catch this case.\n\n```bash\nbd list --status=in_progress --json --limit=0\nbd list --status=hooked --json --limit=0\n```\n\nFor each in_progress or hooked bead with a polecat assignee (format: `\u003crig\u003e/polecats/\u003cname\u003e`):\n1. Only check beads assigned to polecats in YOUR rig\n2. Check tmux session: `gt session status \u003crig\u003e/\u003cname\u003e --json | jq -r '.running'`\n3. Check polecat directory: `ls \u003crig\u003e/polecats/\u003cname\u003e 2\u003e/dev/null`\n4. If BOTH session dead AND directory missing → orphan. Reset the bead:\n   ```bash\n   bd update \u003cbead-id\u003e --status=open --assignee=\n   gt mail send deacon/ -s \"ORPHAN_RECOVERED: \u003cbead-id\u003e\" \\\n     -m \"Bead \u003cbead-id\u003e was assigned to \u003crig\u003e/polecats/\u003cname\u003e which no longer exists.\n   The bead has been reset to open with no assignee.\n   Please re-dispatch to an available polecat.\"\n   ```\n5.

Steps contain **Config:** values that override default behavior.\nIf a config says to skip, you skip. If it specifies a command, you use that\nexact command — not your own assumption. Do NOT guess what a step requires\nbased on the step title or your role knowledge. The step description is the\nsource of truth.\n\n## Variables\n\n| Variable | Default | Description |\n|----------|---------|-------------|\n| wisp_type | patrol | Type of wisp created for this molecule |\n| integration_branch_refinery_enabled | true | Whether refinery merges to integration branches |\n| integration_branch_auto_land | false | Whether to auto-land integration branches when epic children all closed |\n| run_tests | true | Whether to run tests before merging |\n| setup_command | (empty) | Setup/install command (e.g., `pnpm install`). Empty = skip. |\n| typecheck_command | (empty) | Type check command (e.g., `tsc --noEmit`). Empty = skip. |\n| lint_command | (empty) | Lint command (e.g., `eslint .`). Empty = skip. |\n| test_command | go test ./... | Test command to run (if run_tests is true) |\n| build_command | (empty) | Build command (e.g., `go build ./...`). Empty = skip. |\n| target_branch | main | Default target branch for merges |\n| delete_merged_branches | true | Whether to delete source branches after merge |\n\n## FORBIDDEN Actions\n\n- FORBIDDEN: Landing integration branches to the default branch via raw git commands (`git merge`, `git push`).\n  Integration branches may ONLY be landed via `gt mq integration land \u003cepic-id\u003e`.\n  This applies regardless of `auto_land` configuration. The pre-push hook enforces this.\n\n## Step Execution Order\n\nYou MUST process steps in strict DAG order.

A polecat with agent_state=running\nor hook_bead assigned but NO tmux session is a zombie that will sit forever\nundetected unless you proactively check.\n\nFor EVERY polecat with agent_state=running/working OR hook_bead assigned:\n```bash\ngt session status \u003crig\u003e/\u003cname\u003e --json | jq -r '.running' | grep -q true \u0026\u0026 echo ALIVE || echo ZOMBIE\n```\n\n**If ZOMBIE detected** (session missing, agent says working):\n\n1. Check git state to determine if work is recoverable:\n```bash\ncd polecats/\u003cname\u003e/\u003crig\u003e\ngit status --porcelain         # Uncommitted changes?\ngit log @{u}..HEAD      # Unpushed commits?\n```\n\n2. **If clean** (no uncommitted, no unpushed): Auto-nuke immediately.\n```bash\ngt polecat nuke \u003cname\u003e\n```\n\n3. **If dirty** (has unpushed/uncommitted work): Escalate to Deacon for recovery.\n```bash\ngt mail send deacon/ -s \"RECOVERY_NEEDED \u003crig\u003e/\u003cname\u003e\" \\\n  -m \"Polecat: \u003crig\u003e/\u003cname\u003e\nCleanup Status: \u003chas_uncommitted|has_unpushed|has_stash\u003e\nHook Bead: \u003chook_bead\u003e\nDetected: $(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)\n\nZombie detected: tmux session dead, agent_state=\u003cstate\u003e.\nThis polecat has unpushed/uncommitted work that will be lost if nuked.\nPlease coordinate recovery before authorizing cleanup.\"\n```\n\nAlso create a cleanup wisp for tracking:\n```bash\nbd create --ephemeral --title \"cleanup:\u003cname\u003e\" \\\n  --description \"Zombie detected: session dead, state=\u003cagent_state\u003e\" \\\n  --labels cleanup,polecat:\u003cname\u003e,state:zombie-detected\n```\n\n**Step 3: For running polecats (with LIVE session), assess progress**\n\nCheck the hook_bead field to see what they're working on:\n```bash\nbd show \u003chook_bead\u003e  # See current step/issue\n```\n\nYou can also verify they're responsive:\n```bash\ngt peek \u003crig\u003e/\u003cname\u003e 20\n```\n\nLook for:\n- Recent tool activity → making progress\n- Idle at prompt → may need nudge\n- Error messages → may need help\n\n**Step 3a: For idle polecats, auto-nuke if clean**\n\nWhen agent_state=idle, the polecat has no work assigned. Check if it's safe to nuke:\n\n```bash\n# Check git status in the polecat's worktree\ncd polecats/\u003cname\u003e\ngit status --porcelain         # Should be empty (clean)\ngit log @{u}..HEAD      # Should have no unpushed commits\n```\n\n**If clean** (no uncommitted changes, no unpushed commits):\n```bash\n# Safe to nuke - no work to lose\ngt polecat nuke \u003cname\u003e\n```\nLog the auto-nuke for audit purposes. No escalation needed.\n\n**If dirty** (uncommitted or unpushed work):\n```bash\n# Escalate to Deacon - polecat has work that might be valuable\ngt mail send deacon/ -s \\\"IDLE_DIRTY: \u003cpolecat\u003e has uncommitted work\\\" \\\n  -m \\\"Polecat: \u003cname\u003e\nState: idle (no hook_bead)\nGit status: \u003cuncommitted-files\u003e\nUnpushed commits: \u003ccount\u003e\n\nPlease advise: recover work or discard?\\\"\n```\n\n**Rationale**: Idle polecats with clean git state are pure overhead. They have\nno work and no state worth preserving. Nuking them immediately frees resources\nand reduces noise. Only escalate when there's actual work at risk.\n\n**Step 4: Decide action**\n\n| Observation | Action |\n|-------------|--------|\n| agent_state=running, session alive, recent activity | None |\n| agent_state=running, session alive, idle 5-15 min | Gentle nudge |\n| agent_state=running, session alive, idle 15+ min | Direct nudge with deadline |\n| agent_state=running, SESSION DEAD | ZOMBIE — handle in Step 2a |\n| agent_state=stuck | Assess and help or escalate |\n| agent_state=done | Verify cleanup triggered (see Step 4a) |\n\n**Step 4a: Handle agent_state=done**\n\nIn the ephemeral model, polecats with agent_state=done and cleanup_status=clean\nshould already be nuked by HandlePolecatDone. Finding one here indicates:\n\n1. **Stale agent bead** - polecat was nuked but bead remains\n   ```bash\n   # Verify polecat doesn't exist anymore\n   ls polecats/\u003cname\u003e 2\u003e/dev/null || echo \"Already nuked\"\n   ```\n   If nuked, the agent bead is stale. Clean it up or ignore.\n\n2. **Cleanup wisp exists** - polecat has dirty state needing intervention\n   ```bash\n   bd list --label polecat:\u003cname\u003e --status=open\n   ```\n   Process in process-cleanups step.\n\n3. **No wisp, polecat exists** - POLECAT_DONE mail was missed\n   Try auto-nuke directly (ephemeral model):\n   ```bash\n   # Check cleanup_status and nuke if clean\n   gt polecat nuke \u003cname\u003e  # Will fail if dirty\n   ```\n   If nuke fails (dirty state), create cleanup wisp for investigation.\n\n**Step 5: Execute nudges**\n```bash\n# Use --mode=queue to avoid interrupting in-flight tool calls\ngt nudge --mode=queue \u003crig\u003e/polecats/\u003cname\u003e \"How's progress? Need help?\"\n```\n\n**Step 6: Escalate if needed**\n```bash\ngt mail send deacon/ -s \"Escalation: \u003cpolecat\u003e stuck\" \\\n  -m \"Polecat \u003cname\u003e reports stuck. Please intervene.\"\n```\n\n**Parallelism**: Use Task tool subagents to inspect multiple polecats concurrently.\n\n**ZFC Principle**: Trust agent_state from beads for WHAT agents report. But\nverify tmux session existence for WHETHER agents are alive. A dead session with\nagent_state=running is a zombie — the agent cannot correct its own state.\n\n**Step 7: ORPHANED BEAD DETECTION — Scan from beads side**\n\n🚨 **CRITICAL**: Zombie detection (Step 2a) scans FROM polecat directories.\nOnce a polecat is nuked and its directory removed, its beads become invisible\nto zombie detection. Orphaned bead detection scans FROM beads to catch this case.\n\n```bash\nbd list --status=in_progress --json --limit=0\nbd list --status=hooked --json --limit=0\n```\n\nFor each in_progress or hooked bead with a polecat assignee (format: `\u003crig\u003e/polecats/\u003cname\u003e`):\n1. Only check beads assigned to polecats in YOUR rig\n2. Check tmux session: `gt session status \u003crig\u003e/\u003cname\u003e --json | jq -r '.running'`\n3. Check polecat directory: `ls \u003crig\u003e/polecats/\u003cname\u003e 2\u003e/dev/null`\n4. If BOTH session dead AND directory missing → orphan. Reset the bead:\n   ```bash\n   bd update \u003cbead-id\u003e --status=open --assignee=\n   gt mail send deacon/ -s \"ORPHAN_RECOVERED: \u003cbead-id\u003e\" \\\n     -m \"Bead \u003cbead-id\u003e was assigned to \u003crig\u003e/polecats/\u003cname\u003e which no longer exists.\n   The bead has been reset to open with no assignee.\n   Please re-dispatch to an available polecat.\"\n   ```\n5.

If conflicts\narise, Refinery creates a NEW conflict-resolution task for a NEW polecat.\n\n**Key principle**: Polecat lifecycle is separate from MR lifecycle.\n\n## Design Philosophy\n\nThis patrol follows Gas Town principles:\n- **Discovery over tracking**: Observe reality each cycle, with minimal agent-bead state for duration tracking\n- **Events over state**: POLECAT_DONE mail triggers immediate cleanup\n- **Ephemeral by default**: Clean polecats are nuked immediately, no waiting\n- **Cleanup wisps for exceptions**: Only created when intervention needed\n- **Task tool for parallelism**: Subagents inspect polecats, not molecule arms\n\n## Patrol Shape (Linear)\n\n```\ninbox-check ─► process-cleanups ─► check-refinery ─► survey-workers\n                                                            │\n         ┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────┘\n         ▼\n  check-timer-gates ─► check-swarm ─► patrol-cleanup ─► context-check ─► loop-or-exit\n```\n\nNo dynamic arms.

Check if it's safe to nuke:\n\n```bash\n# Check git status in the polecat's worktree\ncd polecats/\u003cname\u003e\ngit status --porcelain         # Should be empty (clean)\ngit log @{u}..HEAD      # Should have no unpushed commits\n```\n\n**If clean** (no uncommitted changes, no unpushed commits):\n```bash\n# Safe to nuke - no work to lose\ngt polecat nuke \u003cname\u003e\n```\nLog the auto-nuke for audit purposes. No escalation needed.\n\n**If dirty** (uncommitted or unpushed work):\n```bash\n# Escalate to Deacon - polecat has work that might be valuable\ngt mail send deacon/ -s \\\"IDLE_DIRTY: \u003cpolecat\u003e has uncommitted work\\\" \\\n  -m \\\"Polecat: \u003cname\u003e\nState: idle (no hook_bead)\nGit status: \u003cuncommitted-files\u003e\nUnpushed commits: \u003ccount\u003e\n\nPlease advise: recover work or discard?\\\"\n```\n\n**Rationale**: Idle polecats with clean git state are pure overhead. They have\nno work and no state worth preserving. Nuking them immediately frees resources\nand reduces noise. Only escalate when there's actual work at risk.\n\n**Step 4: Decide action**\n\n| Observation | Action |\n|-------------|--------|\n| agent_state=running, session alive, recent activity | None |\n| agent_state=running, session alive, idle 5-15 min | Gentle nudge |\n| agent_state=running, session alive, idle 15+ min | Direct nudge with deadline |\n| agent_state=running, SESSION DEAD | ZOMBIE — handle in Step 2a |\n| agent_state=stuck | Assess and help or escalate |\n| agent_state=done | Verify cleanup triggered (see Step 4a) |\n\n**Step 4a: Handle agent_state=done**\n\nIn the ephemeral model, polecats with agent_state=done and cleanup_status=clean\nshould already be nuked by HandlePolecatDone. Finding one here indicates:\n\n1. **Stale agent bead** - polecat was nuked but bead remains\n   ```bash\n   # Verify polecat doesn't exist anymore\n   ls polecats/\u003cname\u003e 2\u003e/dev/null || echo \"Already nuked\"\n   ```\n   If nuked, the agent bead is stale. Clean it up or ignore.\n\n2. **Cleanup wisp exists** - polecat has dirty state needing intervention\n   ```bash\n   bd list --label polecat:\u003cname\u003e --status=open\n   ```\n   Process in process-cleanups step.\n\n3. **No wisp, polecat exists** - POLECAT_DONE mail was missed\n   Try auto-nuke directly (ephemeral model):\n   ```bash\n   # Check cleanup_status and nuke if clean\n   gt polecat nuke \u003cname\u003e  # Will fail if dirty\n   ```\n   If nuke fails (dirty state), create cleanup wisp for investigation.\n\n**Step 5: Execute nudges**\n```bash\n# Use --mode=queue to avoid interrupting in-flight tool calls\ngt nudge --mode=queue \u003crig\u003e/polecats/\u003cname\u003e \"How's progress? Need help?\"\n```\n\n**Step 6: Escalate if needed**\n```bash\ngt mail send deacon/ -s \"Escalation: \u003cpolecat\u003e stuck\" \\\n  -m \"Polecat \u003cname\u003e reports stuck. Please intervene.\"\n```\n\n**Parallelism**: Use Task tool subagents to inspect multiple polecats concurrently.\n\n**ZFC Principle**: Trust agent_state from beads for WHAT agents report. But\nverify tmux session existence for WHETHER agents are alive. A dead session with\nagent_state=running is a zombie — the agent cannot correct its own state.\n\n**Step 7: ORPHANED BEAD DETECTION — Scan from beads side**\n\n🚨 **CRITICAL**: Zombie detection (Step 2a) scans FROM polecat directories.\nOnce a polecat is nuked and its directory removed, its beads become invisible\nto zombie detection. Orphaned bead detection scans FROM beads to catch this case.\n\n```bash\nbd list --status=in_progress --json --limit=0\nbd list --status=hooked --json --limit=0\n```\n\nFor each in_progress or hooked bead with a polecat assignee (format: `\u003crig\u003e/polecats/\u003cname\u003e`):\n1. Only check beads assigned to polecats in YOUR rig\n2. Check tmux session: `gt session status \u003crig\u003e/\u003cname\u003e --json | jq -r '.running'`\n3. Check polecat directory: `ls \u003crig\u003e/polecats/\u003cname\u003e 2\u003e/dev/null`\n4. If BOTH session dead AND directory missing → orphan. Reset the bead:\n   ```bash\n   bd update \u003cbead-id\u003e --status=open --assignee=\n   gt mail send deacon/ -s \"ORPHAN_RECOVERED: \u003cbead-id\u003e\" \\\n     -m \"Bead \u003cbead-id\u003e was assigned to \u003crig\u003e/polecats/\u003cname\u003e which no longer exists.\n   The bead has been reset to open with no assignee.\n   Please re-dispatch to an available polecat.\"\n   ```\n5.

Check git state to determine if work is recoverable:\n```bash\ncd polecats/\u003cname\u003e/\u003crig\u003e\ngit status --porcelain         # Uncommitted changes?\ngit log @{u}..HEAD      # Unpushed commits?\n```\n\n2. **If clean** (no uncommitted, no unpushed): Auto-nuke immediately.\n```bash\ngt polecat nuke \u003cname\u003e\n```\n\n3. **If dirty** (has unpushed/uncommitted work): Escalate to Deacon for recovery.\n```bash\ngt mail send deacon/ -s \"RECOVERY_NEEDED \u003crig\u003e/\u003cname\u003e\" \\\n  -m \"Polecat: \u003crig\u003e/\u003cname\u003e\nCleanup Status: \u003chas_uncommitted|has_unpushed|has_stash\u003e\nHook Bead: \u003chook_bead\u003e\nDetected: $(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)\n\nZombie detected: tmux session dead, agent_state=\u003cstate\u003e.\nThis polecat has unpushed/uncommitted work that will be lost if nuked.\nPlease coordinate recovery before authorizing cleanup.\"\n```\n\nAlso create a cleanup wisp for tracking:\n```bash\nbd create --ephemeral --title \"cleanup:\u003cname\u003e\" \\\n  --description \"Zombie detected: session dead, state=\u003cagent_state\u003e\" \\\n  --labels cleanup,polecat:\u003cname\u003e,state:zombie-detected\n```\n\n**Step 3: For running polecats (with LIVE session), assess progress**\n\nCheck the hook_bead field to see what they're working on:\n```bash\nbd show \u003chook_bead\u003e  # See current step/issue\n```\n\nYou can also verify they're responsive:\n```bash\ngt peek \u003crig\u003e/\u003cname\u003e 20\n```\n\nLook for:\n- Recent tool activity → making progress\n- Idle at prompt → may need nudge\n- Error messages → may need help\n\n**Step 3a: For idle polecats, auto-nuke if clean**\n\nWhen agent_state=idle, the polecat has no work assigned. Check if it's safe to nuke:\n\n```bash\n# Check git status in the polecat's worktree\ncd polecats/\u003cname\u003e\ngit status --porcelain         # Should be empty (clean)\ngit log @{u}..HEAD      # Should have no unpushed commits\n```\n\n**If clean** (no uncommitted changes, no unpushed commits):\n```bash\n# Safe to nuke - no work to lose\ngt polecat nuke \u003cname\u003e\n```\nLog the auto-nuke for audit purposes. No escalation needed.\n\n**If dirty** (uncommitted or unpushed work):\n```bash\n# Escalate to Deacon - polecat has work that might be valuable\ngt mail send deacon/ -s \\\"IDLE_DIRTY: \u003cpolecat\u003e has uncommitted work\\\" \\\n  -m \\\"Polecat: \u003cname\u003e\nState: idle (no hook_bead)\nGit status: \u003cuncommitted-files\u003e\nUnpushed commits: \u003ccount\u003e\n\nPlease advise: recover work or discard?\\\"\n```\n\n**Rationale**: Idle polecats with clean git state are pure overhead. They have\nno work and no state worth preserving. Nuking them immediately frees resources\nand reduces noise. Only escalate when there's actual work at risk.\n\n**Step 4: Decide action**\n\n| Observation | Action |\n|-------------|--------|\n| agent_state=running, session alive, recent activity | None |\n| agent_state=running, session alive, idle 5-15 min | Gentle nudge |\n| agent_state=running, session alive, idle 15+ min | Direct nudge with deadline |\n| agent_state=running, SESSION DEAD | ZOMBIE — handle in Step 2a |\n| agent_state=stuck | Assess and help or escalate |\n| agent_state=done | Verify cleanup triggered (see Step 4a) |\n\n**Step 4a: Handle agent_state=done**\n\nIn the ephemeral model, polecats with agent_state=done and cleanup_status=clean\nshould already be nuked by HandlePolecatDone. Finding one here indicates:\n\n1. **Stale agent bead** - polecat was nuked but bead remains\n   ```bash\n   # Verify polecat doesn't exist anymore\n   ls polecats/\u003cname\u003e 2\u003e/dev/null || echo \"Already nuked\"\n   ```\n   If nuked, the agent bead is stale. Clean it up or ignore.\n\n2. **Cleanup wisp exists** - polecat has dirty state needing intervention\n   ```bash\n   bd list --label polecat:\u003cname\u003e --status=open\n   ```\n   Process in process-cleanups step.\n\n3. **No wisp, polecat exists** - POLECAT_DONE mail was missed\n   Try auto-nuke directly (ephemeral model):\n   ```bash\n   # Check cleanup_status and nuke if clean\n   gt polecat nuke \u003cname\u003e  # Will fail if dirty\n   ```\n   If nuke fails (dirty state), create cleanup wisp for investigation.\n\n**Step 5: Execute nudges**\n```bash\n# Use --mode=queue to avoid interrupting in-flight tool calls\ngt nudge --mode=queue \u003crig\u003e/polecats/\u003cname\u003e \"How's progress? Need help?\"\n```\n\n**Step 6: Escalate if needed**\n```bash\ngt mail send deacon/ -s \"Escalation: \u003cpolecat\u003e stuck\" \\\n  -m \"Polecat \u003cname\u003e reports stuck. Please intervene.\"\n```\n\n**Parallelism**: Use Task tool subagents to inspect multiple polecats concurrently.\n\n**ZFC Principle**: Trust agent_state from beads for WHAT agents report. But\nverify tmux session existence for WHETHER agents are alive. A dead session with\nagent_state=running is a zombie — the agent cannot correct its own state.\n\n**Step 7: ORPHANED BEAD DETECTION — Scan from beads side**\n\n🚨 **CRITICAL**: Zombie detection (Step 2a) scans FROM polecat directories.\nOnce a polecat is nuked and its directory removed, its beads become invisible\nto zombie detection. Orphaned bead detection scans FROM beads to catch this case.\n\n```bash\nbd list --status=in_progress --json --limit=0\nbd list --status=hooked --json --limit=0\n```\n\nFor each in_progress or hooked bead with a polecat assignee (format: `\u003crig\u003e/polecats/\u003cname\u003e`):\n1. Only check beads assigned to polecats in YOUR rig\n2. Check tmux session: `gt session status \u003crig\u003e/\u003cname\u003e --json | jq -r '.running'`\n3. Check polecat directory: `ls \u003crig\u003e/polecats/\u003cname\u003e 2\u003e/dev/null`\n4. If BOTH session dead AND directory missing → orphan. Reset the bead:\n   ```bash\n   bd update \u003cbead-id\u003e --status=open --assignee=\n   gt mail send deacon/ -s \"ORPHAN_RECOVERED: \u003cbead-id\u003e\" \\\n     -m \"Bead \u003cbead-id\u003e was assigned to \u003crig\u003e/polecats/\u003cname\u003e which no longer exists.\n   The bead has been reset to open with no assignee.\n   Please re-dispatch to an available polecat.\"\n   ```\n5. If directory exists but session dead → skip (zombie detection handles it)\n6.

The source branch may have been deleted while the MR bead is still open.\n  These likely need to be closed or investigated.\n\n- **Queue depth**: A large number of unclaimed MRs may indicate the refinery is down\n  or overwhelmed.

Steps contain **Config:** values that override default behavior.\nIf a config says to skip, you skip. If it specifies a command, you use that\nexact command — not your own assumption. Do NOT guess what a step requires\nbased on the step title or your role knowledge. The step description is the\nsource of truth.\n\n## Variables\n\n| Variable | Default | Description |\n|----------|---------|-------------|\n| wisp_type | patrol | Type of wisp created for this molecule |\n| integration_branch_refinery_enabled | true | Whether refinery merges to integration branches |\n| integration_branch_auto_land | false | Whether to auto-land integration branches when epic children all closed |\n| run_tests | true | Whether to run tests before merging |\n| setup_command | (empty) | Setup/install command (e.g., `pnpm install`). Empty = skip. |\n| typecheck_command | (empty) | Type check command (e.g., `tsc --noEmit`). Empty = skip. |\n| lint_command | (empty) | Lint command (e.g., `eslint .`). Empty = skip. |\n| test_command | go test ./... | Test command to run (if run_tests is true) |\n| build_command | (empty) | Build command (e.g., `go build ./...`). Empty = skip. |\n| target_branch | main | Default target branch for merges |\n| delete_merged_branches | true | Whether to delete source branches after merge |\n\n## FORBIDDEN Actions\n\n- FORBIDDEN: Landing integration branches to the default branch via raw git commands (`git merge`, `git push`).\n  Integration branches may ONLY be landed via `gt mq integration land \u003cepic-id\u003e`.\n  This applies regardless of `auto_land` configuration. The pre-push hook enforces this.\n\n## Step Execution Order\n\nYou MUST process steps in strict DAG order.

A polecat with agent_state=running\nor hook_bead assigned but NO tmux session is a zombie that will sit forever\nundetected unless you proactively check.\n\nFor EVERY polecat with agent_state=running/working OR hook_bead assigned:\n```bash\ngt session status \u003crig\u003e/\u003cname\u003e --json | jq -r '.running' | grep -q true \u0026\u0026 echo ALIVE || echo ZOMBIE\n```\n\n**If ZOMBIE detected** (session missing, agent says working):\n\n1. Check git state to determine if work is recoverable:\n```bash\ncd polecats/\u003cname\u003e/\u003crig\u003e\ngit status --porcelain         # Uncommitted changes?\ngit log @{u}..HEAD      # Unpushed commits?\n```\n\n2. **If clean** (no uncommitted, no unpushed): Auto-nuke immediately.\n```bash\ngt polecat nuke \u003cname\u003e\n```\n\n3. **If dirty** (has unpushed/uncommitted work): Escalate to Deacon for recovery.\n```bash\ngt mail send deacon/ -s \"RECOVERY_NEEDED \u003crig\u003e/\u003cname\u003e\" \\\n  -m \"Polecat: \u003crig\u003e/\u003cname\u003e\nCleanup Status: \u003chas_uncommitted|has_unpushed|has_stash\u003e\nHook Bead: \u003chook_bead\u003e\nDetected: $(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)\n\nZombie detected: tmux session dead, agent_state=\u003cstate\u003e.\nThis polecat has unpushed/uncommitted work that will be lost if nuked.\nPlease coordinate recovery before authorizing cleanup.\"\n```\n\nAlso create a cleanup wisp for tracking:\n```bash\nbd create --ephemeral --title \"cleanup:\u003cname\u003e\" \\\n  --description \"Zombie detected: session dead, state=\u003cagent_state\u003e\" \\\n  --labels cleanup,polecat:\u003cname\u003e,state:zombie-detected\n```\n\n**Step 3: For running polecats (with LIVE session), assess progress**\n\nCheck the hook_bead field to see what they're working on:\n```bash\nbd show \u003chook_bead\u003e  # See current step/issue\n```\n\nYou can also verify they're responsive:\n```bash\ngt peek \u003crig\u003e/\u003cname\u003e 20\n```\n\nLook for:\n- Recent tool activity → making progress\n- Idle at prompt → may need nudge\n- Error messages → may need help\n\n**Step 3a: For idle polecats, auto-nuke if clean**\n\nWhen agent_state=idle, the polecat has no work assigned. Check if it's safe to nuke:\n\n```bash\n# Check git status in the polecat's worktree\ncd polecats/\u003cname\u003e\ngit status --porcelain         # Should be empty (clean)\ngit log @{u}..HEAD      # Should have no unpushed commits\n```\n\n**If clean** (no uncommitted changes, no unpushed commits):\n```bash\n# Safe to nuke - no work to lose\ngt polecat nuke \u003cname\u003e\n```\nLog the auto-nuke for audit purposes. No escalation needed.\n\n**If dirty** (uncommitted or unpushed work):\n```bash\n# Escalate to Deacon - polecat has work that might be valuable\ngt mail send deacon/ -s \\\"IDLE_DIRTY: \u003cpolecat\u003e has uncommitted work\\\" \\\n  -m \\\"Polecat: \u003cname\u003e\nState: idle (no hook_bead)\nGit status: \u003cuncommitted-files\u003e\nUnpushed commits: \u003ccount\u003e\n\nPlease advise: recover work or discard?\\\"\n```\n\n**Rationale**: Idle polecats with clean git state are pure overhead. They have\nno work and no state worth preserving. Nuking them immediately frees resources\nand reduces noise. Only escalate when there's actual work at risk.\n\n**Step 4: Decide action**\n\n| Observation | Action |\n|-------------|--------|\n| agent_state=running, session alive, recent activity | None |\n| agent_state=running, session alive, idle 5-15 min | Gentle nudge |\n| agent_state=running, session alive, idle 15+ min | Direct nudge with deadline |\n| agent_state=running, SESSION DEAD | ZOMBIE — handle in Step 2a |\n| agent_state=stuck | Assess and help or escalate |\n| agent_state=done | Verify cleanup triggered (see Step 4a) |\n\n**Step 4a: Handle agent_state=done**\n\nIn the ephemeral model, polecats with agent_state=done and cleanup_status=clean\nshould already be nuked by HandlePolecatDone. Finding one here indicates:\n\n1. **Stale agent bead** - polecat was nuked but bead remains\n   ```bash\n   # Verify polecat doesn't exist anymore\n   ls polecats/\u003cname\u003e 2\u003e/dev/null || echo \"Already nuked\"\n   ```\n   If nuked, the agent bead is stale. Clean it up or ignore.\n\n2. **Cleanup wisp exists** - polecat has dirty state needing intervention\n   ```bash\n   bd list --label polecat:\u003cname\u003e --status=open\n   ```\n   Process in process-cleanups step.\n\n3. **No wisp, polecat exists** - POLECAT_DONE mail was missed\n   Try auto-nuke directly (ephemeral model):\n   ```bash\n   # Check cleanup_status and nuke if clean\n   gt polecat nuke \u003cname\u003e  # Will fail if dirty\n   ```\n   If nuke fails (dirty state), create cleanup wisp for investigation.\n\n**Step 5: Execute nudges**\n```bash\n# Use --mode=queue to avoid interrupting in-flight tool calls\ngt nudge --mode=queue \u003crig\u003e/polecats/\u003cname\u003e \"How's progress? Need help?\"\n```\n\n**Step 6: Escalate if needed**\n```bash\ngt mail send deacon/ -s \"Escalation: \u003cpolecat\u003e stuck\" \\\n  -m \"Polecat \u003cname\u003e reports stuck. Please intervene.\"\n```\n\n**Parallelism**: Use Task tool subagents to inspect multiple polecats concurrently.\n\n**ZFC Principle**: Trust agent_state from beads for WHAT agents report. But\nverify tmux session existence for WHETHER agents are alive. A dead session with\nagent_state=running is a zombie — the agent cannot correct its own state.\n\n**Step 7: ORPHANED BEAD DETECTION — Scan from beads side**\n\n🚨 **CRITICAL**: Zombie detection (Step 2a) scans FROM polecat directories.\nOnce a polecat is nuked and its directory removed, its beads become invisible\nto zombie detection. Orphaned bead detection scans FROM beads to catch this case.\n\n```bash\nbd list --status=in_progress --json --limit=0\nbd list --status=hooked --json --limit=0\n```\n\nFor each in_progress or hooked bead with a polecat assignee (format: `\u003crig\u003e/polecats/\u003cname\u003e`):\n1. Only check beads assigned to polecats in YOUR rig\n2. Check tmux session: `gt session status \u003crig\u003e/\u003cname\u003e --json | jq -r '.running'`\n3. Check polecat directory: `ls \u003crig\u003e/polecats/\u003cname\u003e 2\u003e/dev/null`\n4. If BOTH session dead AND directory missing → orphan. Reset the bead:\n   ```bash\n   bd update \u003cbead-id\u003e --status=open --assignee=\n   gt mail send deacon/ -s \"ORPHAN_RECOVERED: \u003cbead-id\u003e\" \\\n     -m \"Bead \u003cbead-id\u003e was assigned to \u003crig\u003e/polecats/\u003cname\u003e which no longer exists.\n   The bead has been reset to open with no assignee.\n   Please re-dispatch to an available polecat.\"\n   ```\n5.

Check if it's safe to nuke:\n\n```bash\n# Check git status in the polecat's worktree\ncd polecats/\u003cname\u003e\ngit status --porcelain         # Should be empty (clean)\ngit log @{u}..HEAD      # Should have no unpushed commits\n```\n\n**If clean** (no uncommitted changes, no unpushed commits):\n```bash\n# Safe to nuke - no work to lose\ngt polecat nuke \u003cname\u003e\n```\nLog the auto-nuke for audit purposes. No escalation needed.\n\n**If dirty** (uncommitted or unpushed work):\n```bash\n# Escalate to Deacon - polecat has work that might be valuable\ngt mail send deacon/ -s \\\"IDLE_DIRTY: \u003cpolecat\u003e has uncommitted work\\\" \\\n  -m \\\"Polecat: \u003cname\u003e\nState: idle (no hook_bead)\nGit status: \u003cuncommitted-files\u003e\nUnpushed commits: \u003ccount\u003e\n\nPlease advise: recover work or discard?\\\"\n```\n\n**Rationale**: Idle polecats with clean git state are pure overhead. They have\nno work and no state worth preserving. Nuking them immediately frees resources\nand reduces noise. Only escalate when there's actual work at risk.\n\n**Step 4: Decide action**\n\n| Observation | Action |\n|-------------|--------|\n| agent_state=running, session alive, recent activity | None |\n| agent_state=running, session alive, idle 5-15 min | Gentle nudge |\n| agent_state=running, session alive, idle 15+ min | Direct nudge with deadline |\n| agent_state=running, SESSION DEAD | ZOMBIE — handle in Step 2a |\n| agent_state=stuck | Assess and help or escalate |\n| agent_state=done | Verify cleanup triggered (see Step 4a) |\n\n**Step 4a: Handle agent_state=done**\n\nIn the ephemeral model, polecats with agent_state=done and cleanup_status=clean\nshould already be nuked by HandlePolecatDone. Finding one here indicates:\n\n1. **Stale agent bead** - polecat was nuked but bead remains\n   ```bash\n   # Verify polecat doesn't exist anymore\n   ls polecats/\u003cname\u003e 2\u003e/dev/null || echo \"Already nuked\"\n   ```\n   If nuked, the agent bead is stale. Clean it up or ignore.\n\n2. **Cleanup wisp exists** - polecat has dirty state needing intervention\n   ```bash\n   bd list --label polecat:\u003cname\u003e --status=open\n   ```\n   Process in process-cleanups step.\n\n3. **No wisp, polecat exists** - POLECAT_DONE mail was missed\n   Try auto-nuke directly (ephemeral model):\n   ```bash\n   # Check cleanup_status and nuke if clean\n   gt polecat nuke \u003cname\u003e  # Will fail if dirty\n   ```\n   If nuke fails (dirty state), create cleanup wisp for investigation.\n\n**Step 5: Execute nudges**\n```bash\n# Use --mode=queue to avoid interrupting in-flight tool calls\ngt nudge --mode=queue \u003crig\u003e/polecats/\u003cname\u003e \"How's progress? Need help?\"\n```\n\n**Step 6: Escalate if needed**\n```bash\ngt mail send deacon/ -s \"Escalation: \u003cpolecat\u003e stuck\" \\\n  -m \"Polecat \u003cname\u003e reports stuck. Please intervene.\"\n```\n\n**Parallelism**: Use Task tool subagents to inspect multiple polecats concurrently.\n\n**ZFC Principle**: Trust agent_state from beads for WHAT agents report. But\nverify tmux session existence for WHETHER agents are alive. A dead session with\nagent_state=running is a zombie — the agent cannot correct its own state.\n\n**Step 7: ORPHANED BEAD DETECTION — Scan from beads side**\n\n🚨 **CRITICAL**: Zombie detection (Step 2a) scans FROM polecat directories.\nOnce a polecat is nuked and its directory removed, its beads become invisible\nto zombie detection. Orphaned bead detection scans FROM beads to catch this case.\n\n```bash\nbd list --status=in_progress --json --limit=0\nbd list --status=hooked --json --limit=0\n```\n\nFor each in_progress or hooked bead with a polecat assignee (format: `\u003crig\u003e/polecats/\u003cname\u003e`):\n1. Only check beads assigned to polecats in YOUR rig\n2. Check tmux session: `gt session status \u003crig\u003e/\u003cname\u003e --json | jq -r '.running'`\n3. Check polecat directory: `ls \u003crig\u003e/polecats/\u003cname\u003e 2\u003e/dev/null`\n4. If BOTH session dead AND directory missing → orphan. Reset the bead:\n   ```bash\n   bd update \u003cbead-id\u003e --status=open --assignee=\n   gt mail send deacon/ -s \"ORPHAN_RECOVERED: \u003cbead-id\u003e\" \\\n     -m \"Bead \u003cbead-id\u003e was assigned to \u003crig\u003e/polecats/\u003cname\u003e which no longer exists.\n   The bead has been reset to open with no assignee.\n   Please re-dispatch to an available polecat.\"\n   ```\n5.

Use the single resolved bead ID as YOUR_AGENT_BEAD in the commands below.\n\nThen use await-signal with exponential backoff to wait for activity:\n\n```bash\ngt mol step await-signal --agent-bead YOUR_AGENT_BEAD \\\n  --backoff-base 30s --backoff-mult 2 --backoff-max 5m\n```\n\nThis command:\n1. Subscribes to `bd activity --follow` (beads activity feed)\n2. Returns IMMEDIATELY when any beads activity occurs\n3. If no activity, times out with exponential backoff:\n   - First timeout: 30s\n   - Second timeout: 60s\n   - Third timeout: 120s\n   - ...capped at 5 minutes max\n4. Tracks `idle:N` label on your agent bead for backoff state\n\n**On signal received** (activity detected):\nReset the idle counter and start next patrol cycle:\n```bash\ngt agent state YOUR_AGENT_BEAD --set idle=0\n```\n\n**On timeout** (no activity):\nThe idle counter was auto-incremented. Continue to next patrol cycle\n(the longer backoff will apply next time).\n\nAfter await-signal returns (either by signal or timeout):\n1. Generate a brief summary of this patrol cycle\n2. Squash the current wisp:\n```bash\ngt mol squash --jitter 10s --summary \"\u003cpatrol-summary\u003e\"\n```\n3. Create and hook a new patrol wisp:\n```bash\nNEW_WISP=$(bd mol wisp mol-witness-patrol --json | jq -r '.new_epic_id')\nbd update \"$NEW_WISP\" --status=hooked --assignee=\u003crig\u003e/witness\n```\n4. Continue executing from the inbox-check step of the new wisp\n\n**If context HIGH** (approaching limit):\n1. Write handoff mail with notable observations:\n```bash\ngt handoff -s \"Witness patrol handoff\" -m \"\u003cobservations\u003e\"\n```\n2. Exit cleanly - the daemon will respawn a fresh Witness session\n\n**IMPORTANT**: You must either create a new wisp (context LOW) or exit (context HIGH).\nNever leave the session idle without work on your hook.","design":"","due_at":null,"ephemeral":0,"estimated_minutes":null,"event_kind":"","external_ref":null,"hook_bead":"","id":"gt-mol-9gav","is_template":0,"issue_type":"task","last_activity":null,"metadata":"{}","mol_type":"","notes":"","original_size":null,"owner":"","payload":"","pinned":0,"priority":2,"quality_score":null,"rig":"","role_bead":"","role_type":"","sender":"","source_repo":"","source_system":"","spec_id":"","status":"closed","target":"","timeout_ns":0,"title":"Loop or exit for respawn","updated_at":"2026-02-22T05:51:36Z","waiters":"","wisp_type":"","work_type":""}

A polecat with agent_state=running\nor hook_bead assigned but NO tmux session is a zombie that will sit forever\nundetected unless you proactively check.\n\nFor EVERY polecat with agent_state=running/working OR hook_bead assigned:\n```bash\ngt session status \u003crig\u003e/\u003cname\u003e --json | jq -r '.running' | grep -q true \u0026\u0026 echo ALIVE || echo ZOMBIE\n```\n\n**If ZOMBIE detected** (session missing, agent says working):\n\n1.

Check if it's safe to nuke:\n\n```bash\n# Check git status in the polecat's worktree\ncd polecats/\u003cname\u003e\ngit status --porcelain         # Should be empty (clean)\ngit log @{u}..HEAD      # Should have no unpushed commits\n```\n\n**If clean** (no uncommitted changes, no unpushed commits):\n```bash\n# Safe to nuke - no work to lose\ngt polecat nuke \u003cname\u003e\n```\nLog the auto-nuke for audit purposes. No escalation needed.\n\n**If dirty** (uncommitted or unpushed work):\n```bash\n# Escalate to Deacon - polecat has work that might be valuable\ngt mail send deacon/ -s \\\"IDLE_DIRTY: \u003cpolecat\u003e has uncommitted work\\\" \\\n  -m \\\"Polecat: \u003cname\u003e\nState: idle (no hook_bead)\nGit status: \u003cuncommitted-files\u003e\nUnpushed commits: \u003ccount\u003e\n\nPlease advise: recover work or discard?\\\"\n```\n\n**Rationale**: Idle polecats with clean git state are pure overhead. They have\nno work and no state worth preserving. Nuking them immediately frees resources\nand reduces noise. Only escalate when there's actual work at risk.\n\n**Step 4: Decide action**\n\n| Observation | Action |\n|-------------|--------|\n| agent_state=running, session alive, recent activity | None |\n| agent_state=running, session alive, idle 5-15 min | Gentle nudge |\n| agent_state=running, session alive, idle 15+ min | Direct nudge with deadline |\n| agent_state=running, SESSION DEAD | ZOMBIE — handle in Step 2a |\n| agent_state=stuck | Assess and help or escalate |\n| agent_state=done | Verify cleanup triggered (see Step 4a) |\n\n**Step 4a: Handle agent_state=done**\n\nIn the ephemeral model, polecats with agent_state=done and cleanup_status=clean\nshould already be nuked by HandlePolecatDone. Finding one here indicates:\n\n1. **Stale agent bead** - polecat was nuked but bead remains\n   ```bash\n   # Verify polecat doesn't exist anymore\n   ls polecats/\u003cname\u003e 2\u003e/dev/null || echo \"Already nuked\"\n   ```\n   If nuked, the agent bead is stale. Clean it up or ignore.\n\n2. **Cleanup wisp exists** - polecat has dirty state needing intervention\n   ```bash\n   bd list --label polecat:\u003cname\u003e --status=open\n   ```\n   Process in process-cleanups step.\n\n3. **No wisp, polecat exists** - POLECAT_DONE mail was missed\n   Try auto-nuke directly (ephemeral model):\n   ```bash\n   # Check cleanup_status and nuke if clean\n   gt polecat nuke \u003cname\u003e  # Will fail if dirty\n   ```\n   If nuke fails (dirty state), create cleanup wisp for investigation.\n\n**Step 5: Execute nudges**\n```bash\n# Use --mode=queue to avoid interrupting in-flight tool calls\ngt nudge --mode=queue \u003crig\u003e/polecats/\u003cname\u003e \"How's progress? Need help?\"\n```\n\n**Step 6: Escalate if needed**\n```bash\ngt mail send deacon/ -s \"Escalation: \u003cpolecat\u003e stuck\" \\\n  -m \"Polecat \u003cname\u003e reports stuck. Please intervene.\"\n```\n\n**Parallelism**: Use Task tool subagents to inspect multiple polecats concurrently.\n\n**ZFC Principle**: Trust agent_state from beads for WHAT agents report. But\nverify tmux session existence for WHETHER agents are alive. A dead session with\nagent_state=running is a zombie — the agent cannot correct its own state.\n\n**Step 7: ORPHANED BEAD DETECTION — Scan from beads side**\n\n🚨 **CRITICAL**: Zombie detection (Step 2a) scans FROM polecat directories.\nOnce a polecat is nuked and its directory removed, its beads become invisible\nto zombie detection. Orphaned bead detection scans FROM beads to catch this case.\n\n```bash\nbd list --status=in_progress --json --limit=0\nbd list --status=hooked --json --limit=0\n```\n\nFor each in_progress or hooked bead with a polecat assignee (format: `\u003crig\u003e/polecats/\u003cname\u003e`):\n1. Only check beads assigned to polecats in YOUR rig\n2. Check tmux session: `gt session status \u003crig\u003e/\u003cname\u003e --json | jq -r '.running'`\n3. Check polecat directory: `ls \u003crig\u003e/polecats/\u003cname\u003e 2\u003e/dev/null`\n4. If BOTH session dead AND directory missing → orphan. Reset the bead:\n   ```bash\n   bd update \u003cbead-id\u003e --status=open --assignee=\n   gt mail send deacon/ -s \"ORPHAN_RECOVERED: \u003cbead-id\u003e\" \\\n     -m \"Bead \u003cbead-id\u003e was assigned to \u003crig\u003e/polecats/\u003cname\u003e which no longer exists.\n   The bead has been reset to open with no assignee.\n   Please re-dispatch to an available polecat.\"\n   ```\n5.

Steps contain **Config:** values that override default behavior.\nIf a config says to skip, you skip. If it specifies a command, you use that\nexact command — not your own assumption. Do NOT guess what a step requires\nbased on the step title or your role knowledge. The step description is the\nsource of truth.\n\n## Variables\n\n| Variable | Default | Description |\n|----------|---------|-------------|\n| wisp_type | patrol | Type of wisp created for this molecule |\n| integration_branch_refinery_enabled | true | Whether refinery merges to integration branches |\n| integration_branch_auto_land | false | Whether to auto-land integration branches when epic children all closed |\n| run_tests | true | Whether to run tests before merging |\n| setup_command | (empty) | Setup/install command (e.g., `pnpm install`). Empty = skip. |\n| typecheck_command | (empty) | Type check command (e.g., `tsc --noEmit`). Empty = skip. |\n| lint_command | (empty) | Lint command (e.g., `eslint .`). Empty = skip. |\n| test_command | go test ./... | Test command to run (if run_tests is true) |\n| build_command | (empty) | Build command (e.g., `go build ./...`). Empty = skip. |\n| target_branch | main | Default target branch for merges |\n| delete_merged_branches | true | Whether to delete source branches after merge |\n\n## FORBIDDEN Actions\n\n- FORBIDDEN: Landing integration branches to the default branch via raw git commands (`git merge`, `git push`).\n  Integration branches may ONLY be landed via `gt mq integration land \u003cepic-id\u003e`.\n  This applies regardless of `auto_land` configuration. The pre-push hook enforces this.\n\n## Step Execution Order\n\nYou MUST process steps in strict DAG order.

A polecat with agent_state=running\nor hook_bead assigned but NO tmux session is a zombie that will sit forever\nundetected unless you proactively check.\n\nFor EVERY polecat with agent_state=running/working OR hook_bead assigned:\n```bash\ngt session status \u003crig\u003e/\u003cname\u003e --json | jq -r '.running' | grep -q true \u0026\u0026 echo ALIVE || echo ZOMBIE\n```\n\n**If ZOMBIE detected** (session missing, agent says working):\n\n1.

Check if it's safe to nuke:\n\n```bash\n# Check git status in the polecat's worktree\ncd polecats/\u003cname\u003e\ngit status --porcelain         # Should be empty (clean)\ngit log @{u}..HEAD      # Should have no unpushed commits\n```\n\n**If clean** (no uncommitted changes, no unpushed commits):\n```bash\n# Safe to nuke - no work to lose\ngt polecat nuke \u003cname\u003e\n```\nLog the auto-nuke for audit purposes. No escalation needed.\n\n**If dirty** (uncommitted or unpushed work):\n```bash\n# Escalate to Deacon - polecat has work that might be valuable\ngt mail send deacon/ -s \\\"IDLE_DIRTY: \u003cpolecat\u003e has uncommitted work\\\" \\\n  -m \\\"Polecat: \u003cname\u003e\nState: idle (no hook_bead)\nGit status: \u003cuncommitted-files\u003e\nUnpushed commits: \u003ccount\u003e\n\nPlease advise: recover work or discard?\\\"\n```\n\n**Rationale**: Idle polecats with clean git state are pure overhead. They have\nno work and no state worth preserving. Nuking them immediately frees resources\nand reduces noise. Only escalate when there's actual work at risk.\n\n**Step 4: Decide action**\n\n| Observation | Action |\n|-------------|--------|\n| agent_state=running, session alive, recent activity | None |\n| agent_state=running, session alive, idle 5-15 min | Gentle nudge |\n| agent_state=running, session alive, idle 15+ min | Direct nudge with deadline |\n| agent_state=running, SESSION DEAD | ZOMBIE — handle in Step 2a |\n| agent_state=stuck | Assess and help or escalate |\n| agent_state=done | Verify cleanup triggered (see Step 4a) |\n\n**Step 4a: Handle agent_state=done**\n\nIn the ephemeral model, polecats with agent_state=done and cleanup_status=clean\nshould already be nuked by HandlePolecatDone. Finding one here indicates:\n\n1. **Stale agent bead** - polecat was nuked but bead remains\n   ```bash\n   # Verify polecat doesn't exist anymore\n   ls polecats/\u003cname\u003e 2\u003e/dev/null || echo \"Already nuked\"\n   ```\n   If nuked, the agent bead is stale. Clean it up or ignore.\n\n2. **Cleanup wisp exists** - polecat has dirty state needing intervention\n   ```bash\n   bd list --label polecat:\u003cname\u003e --status=open\n   ```\n   Process in process-cleanups step.\n\n3. **No wisp, polecat exists** - POLECAT_DONE mail was missed\n   Try auto-nuke directly (ephemeral model):\n   ```bash\n   # Check cleanup_status and nuke if clean\n   gt polecat nuke \u003cname\u003e  # Will fail if dirty\n   ```\n   If nuke fails (dirty state), create cleanup wisp for investigation.\n\n**Step 5: Execute nudges**\n```bash\n# Use --mode=queue to avoid interrupting in-flight tool calls\ngt nudge --mode=queue \u003crig\u003e/polecats/\u003cname\u003e \"How's progress? Need help?\"\n```\n\n**Step 6: Escalate if needed**\n```bash\ngt mail send deacon/ -s \"Escalation: \u003cpolecat\u003e stuck\" \\\n  -m \"Polecat \u003cname\u003e reports stuck. Please intervene.\"\n```\n\n**Parallelism**: Use Task tool subagents to inspect multiple polecats concurrently.\n\n**ZFC Principle**: Trust agent_state from beads for WHAT agents report. But\nverify tmux session existence for WHETHER agents are alive. A dead session with\nagent_state=running is a zombie — the agent cannot correct its own state.\n\n**Step 7: ORPHANED BEAD DETECTION — Scan from beads side**\n\n🚨 **CRITICAL**: Zombie detection (Step 2a) scans FROM polecat directories.\nOnce a polecat is nuked and its directory removed, its beads become invisible\nto zombie detection. Orphaned bead detection scans FROM beads to catch this case.\n\n```bash\nbd list --status=in_progress --json --limit=0\nbd list --status=hooked --json --limit=0\n```\n\nFor each in_progress or hooked bead with a polecat assignee (format: `\u003crig\u003e/polecats/\u003cname\u003e`):\n1. Only check beads assigned to polecats in YOUR rig\n2. Check tmux session: `gt session status \u003crig\u003e/\u003cname\u003e --json | jq -r '.running'`\n3. Check polecat directory: `ls \u003crig\u003e/polecats/\u003cname\u003e 2\u003e/dev/null`\n4. If BOTH session dead AND directory missing → orphan. Reset the bead:\n   ```bash\n   bd update \u003cbead-id\u003e --status=open --assignee=\n   gt mail send deacon/ -s \"ORPHAN_RECOVERED: \u003cbead-id\u003e\" \\\n     -m \"Bead \u003cbead-id\u003e was assigned to \u003crig\u003e/polecats/\u003cname\u003e which no longer exists.\n   The bead has been reset to open with no assignee.\n   Please re-dispatch to an available polecat.\"\n   ```\n5. If directory exists but session dead → skip (zombie detection handles it)\n6. If session alive → not an orphan, skip\n\n**Step 8: File likely GT bugs discovered during patrol**\n\nWhen findings look like platform/tooling defects (not ordinary stuck-worker situations), file a bug bead before or alongside escalation:\n\n```bash\nbd create --rig \u003crig\u003e --type bug --priority 1 \\\n  --title \"Witness patrol bug: \u003cshort symptom\u003e\" \\\n  --description \"Detected by \u003crig\u003e/witness during survey-workers.\nSymptoms: \u003cwhat failed\u003e\nContext: \u003cpolecat/issue IDs, command output\u003e\nReproduction: \u003cminimal steps\u003e\"\n```\n\nExamples: duplicate dispatch behavior, cleanup_status false alarms, branch-name handling regressions, unexpected destructive nuke behavior.","design":"","due_at":null,"ephemeral":0,"estimated_minutes":null,"event_kind":"","external_ref":null,"hook_bead":"","id":"gt-mol-c196x","is_template":0,"issue_type":"task","last_activity":null,"metadata":"{}","mol_type":"","notes":"","original_size":null,"owner":"","payload":"","pinned":0,"priority":2,"quality_score":null,"rig":"","role_bead":"","role_type":"","sender":"","source_repo":"","source_system":"","spec_id":"","status":"closed","target":"","timeout_ns":0,"title":"Inspect all active polecats","updated_at":"2026-02-23T19:20:41Z","waiters":"","wisp_type":"","work_type":""}

Check if it's safe to nuke:\n\n```bash\n# Check git status in the polecat's worktree\ncd polecats/\u003cname\u003e\ngit status --porcelain         # Should be empty (clean)\ngit log @{u}..HEAD      # Should have no unpushed commits\n```\n\n**If clean** (no uncommitted changes, no unpushed commits):\n```bash\n# Safe to nuke - no work to lose\ngt polecat nuke \u003cname\u003e\n```\nLog the auto-nuke for audit purposes. No escalation needed.\n\n**If dirty** (uncommitted or unpushed work):\n```bash\n# Escalate to Deacon - polecat has work that might be valuable\ngt mail send deacon/ -s \\\"IDLE_DIRTY: \u003cpolecat\u003e has uncommitted work\\\" \\\n  -m \\\"Polecat: \u003cname\u003e\nState: idle (no hook_bead)\nGit status: \u003cuncommitted-files\u003e\nUnpushed commits: \u003ccount\u003e\n\nPlease advise: recover work or discard?\\\"\n```\n\n**Rationale**: Idle polecats with clean git state are pure overhead. They have\nno work and no state worth preserving. Nuking them immediately frees resources\nand reduces noise. Only escalate when there's actual work at risk.\n\n**Step 4: Decide action**\n\n| Observation | Action |\n|-------------|--------|\n| agent_state=running, session alive, recent activity | None |\n| agent_state=running, session alive, idle 5-15 min | Gentle nudge |\n| agent_state=running, session alive, idle 15+ min | Direct nudge with deadline |\n| agent_state=running, SESSION DEAD | ZOMBIE — handle in Step 2a |\n| agent_state=stuck | Assess and help or escalate |\n| agent_state=done | Verify cleanup triggered (see Step 4a) |\n\n**Step 4a: Handle agent_state=done**\n\nIn the ephemeral model, polecats with agent_state=done and cleanup_status=clean\nshould already be nuked by HandlePolecatDone. Finding one here indicates:\n\n1. **Stale agent bead** - polecat was nuked but bead remains\n   ```bash\n   # Verify polecat doesn't exist anymore\n   ls polecats/\u003cname\u003e 2\u003e/dev/null || echo \"Already nuked\"\n   ```\n   If nuked, the agent bead is stale. Clean it up or ignore.\n\n2. **Cleanup wisp exists** - polecat has dirty state needing intervention\n   ```bash\n   bd list --label polecat:\u003cname\u003e --status=open\n   ```\n   Process in process-cleanups step.\n\n3. **No wisp, polecat exists** - POLECAT_DONE mail was missed\n   Try auto-nuke directly (ephemeral model):\n   ```bash\n   # Check cleanup_status and nuke if clean\n   gt polecat nuke \u003cname\u003e  # Will fail if dirty\n   ```\n   If nuke fails (dirty state), create cleanup wisp for investigation.\n\n**Step 5: Execute nudges**\n```bash\n# Use --mode=queue to avoid interrupting in-flight tool calls\ngt nudge --mode=queue \u003crig\u003e/polecats/\u003cname\u003e \"How's progress? Need help?\"\n```\n\n**Step 6: Escalate if needed**\n```bash\ngt mail send deacon/ -s \"Escalation: \u003cpolecat\u003e stuck\" \\\n  -m \"Polecat \u003cname\u003e reports stuck. Please intervene.\"\n```\n\n**Parallelism**: Use Task tool subagents to inspect multiple polecats concurrently.\n\n**ZFC Principle**: Trust agent_state from beads for WHAT agents report. But\nverify tmux session existence for WHETHER agents are alive. A dead session with\nagent_state=running is a zombie — the agent cannot correct its own state.\n\n**Step 7: ORPHANED BEAD DETECTION — Scan from beads side**\n\n🚨 **CRITICAL**: Zombie detection (Step 2a) scans FROM polecat directories.\nOnce a polecat is nuked and its directory removed, its beads become invisible\nto zombie detection. Orphaned bead detection scans FROM beads to catch this case.\n\n```bash\nbd list --status=in_progress --json --limit=0\nbd list --status=hooked --json --limit=0\n```\n\nFor each in_progress or hooked bead with a polecat assignee (format: `\u003crig\u003e/polecats/\u003cname\u003e`):\n1. Only check beads assigned to polecats in YOUR rig\n2. Check tmux session: `gt session status \u003crig\u003e/\u003cname\u003e --json | jq -r '.running'`\n3. Check polecat directory: `ls \u003crig\u003e/polecats/\u003cname\u003e 2\u003e/dev/null`\n4. If BOTH session dead AND directory missing → orphan. Reset the bead:\n   ```bash\n   bd update \u003cbead-id\u003e --status=open --assignee=\n   gt mail send deacon/ -s \"ORPHAN_RECOVERED: \u003cbead-id\u003e\" \\\n     -m \"Bead \u003cbead-id\u003e was assigned to \u003crig\u003e/polecats/\u003cname\u003e which no longer exists.\n   The bead has been reset to open with no assignee.\n   Please re-dispatch to an available polecat.\"\n   ```\n5. If directory exists but session dead → skip (zombie detection handles it)\n6.

But\nverify tmux session existence for WHETHER agents are alive. A dead session with\nagent_state=running is a zombie — the agent cannot correct its own state.\n\n**Step 7: ORPHANED BEAD DETECTION — Scan from beads side**\n\n🚨 **CRITICAL**: Zombie detection (Step 2a) scans FROM polecat directories.\nOnce a polecat is nuked and its directory removed, its beads become invisible\nto zombie detection. Orphaned bead detection scans FROM beads to catch this case.\n\n```bash\nbd list --status=in_progress --json --limit=0\nbd list --status=hooked --json --limit=0\n```\n\nFor each in_progress or hooked bead with a polecat assignee (format: `\u003crig\u003e/polecats/\u003cname\u003e`):\n1. Only check beads assigned to polecats in YOUR rig\n2. Check tmux session: `gt session status \u003crig\u003e/\u003cname\u003e --json | jq -r '.running'`\n3. Check polecat directory: `ls \u003crig\u003e/polecats/\u003cname\u003e 2\u003e/dev/null`\n4. If BOTH session dead AND directory missing → orphan.

Please intervene.\"\n```\n\n**Parallelism**: Use Task tool subagents to inspect multiple polecats concurrently.\n\n**ZFC Principle**: Trust agent_state from beads for WHAT agents report. But\nverify tmux session existence for WHETHER agents are alive. A dead session with\nagent_state=running is a zombie — the agent cannot correct its own state.\n\n**Step 7: ORPHANED BEAD DETECTION — Scan from beads side**\n\n🚨 **CRITICAL**: Zombie detection (Step 2a) scans FROM polecat directories.\nOnce a polecat is nuked and its directory removed, its beads become invisible\nto zombie detection. Orphaned bead detection scans FROM beads to catch this case.\n\n```bash\nbd list --status=in_progress --json --limit=0\nbd list --status=hooked --json --limit=0\n```\n\nFor each in_progress or hooked bead with a polecat assignee (format: `\u003crig\u003e/polecats/\u003cname\u003e`):\n1. Only check beads assigned to polecats in YOUR rig\n2. Check tmux session: `gt session status \u003crig\u003e/\u003cname\u003e --json | jq -r '.running'`\n3. Check polecat directory: `ls \u003crig\u003e/polecats/\u003cname\u003e 2\u003e/dev/null`\n4. If BOTH session dead AND directory missing → orphan.

Check if it's safe to nuke:\n\n```bash\n# Check git status in the polecat's worktree\ncd polecats/\u003cname\u003e\ngit status --porcelain         # Should be empty (clean)\ngit log @{u}..HEAD      # Should have no unpushed commits\n```\n\n**If clean** (no uncommitted changes, no unpushed commits):\n```bash\n# Safe to nuke - no work to lose\ngt polecat nuke \u003cname\u003e\n```\nLog the auto-nuke for audit purposes. No escalation needed.\n\n**If dirty** (uncommitted or unpushed work):\n```bash\n# Escalate to Deacon - polecat has work that might be valuable\ngt mail send deacon/ -s \\\"IDLE_DIRTY: \u003cpolecat\u003e has uncommitted work\\\" \\\n  -m \\\"Polecat: \u003cname\u003e\nState: idle (no hook_bead)\nGit status: \u003cuncommitted-files\u003e\nUnpushed commits: \u003ccount\u003e\n\nPlease advise: recover work or discard?\\\"\n```\n\n**Rationale**: Idle polecats with clean git state are pure overhead. They have\nno work and no state worth preserving. Nuking them immediately frees resources\nand reduces noise. Only escalate when there's actual work at risk.\n\n**Step 4: Decide action**\n\n| Observation | Action |\n|-------------|--------|\n| agent_state=running, session alive, recent activity | None |\n| agent_state=running, session alive, idle 5-15 min | Gentle nudge |\n| agent_state=running, session alive, idle 15+ min | Direct nudge with deadline |\n| agent_state=running, SESSION DEAD | ZOMBIE — handle in Step 2a |\n| agent_state=stuck | Assess and help or escalate |\n| agent_state=done | Verify cleanup triggered (see Step 4a) |\n\n**Step 4a: Handle agent_state=done**\n\nIn the ephemeral model, polecats with agent_state=done and cleanup_status=clean\nshould already be nuked by HandlePolecatDone. Finding one here indicates:\n\n1. **Stale agent bead** - polecat was nuked but bead remains\n   ```bash\n   # Verify polecat doesn't exist anymore\n   ls polecats/\u003cname\u003e 2\u003e/dev/null || echo \"Already nuked\"\n   ```\n   If nuked, the agent bead is stale. Clean it up or ignore.\n\n2. **Cleanup wisp exists** - polecat has dirty state needing intervention\n   ```bash\n   bd list --label polecat:\u003cname\u003e --status=open\n   ```\n   Process in process-cleanups step.\n\n3. **No wisp, polecat exists** - POLECAT_DONE mail was missed\n   Try auto-nuke directly (ephemeral model):\n   ```bash\n   # Check cleanup_status and nuke if clean\n   gt polecat nuke \u003cname\u003e  # Will fail if dirty\n   ```\n   If nuke fails (dirty state), create cleanup wisp for investigation.\n\n**Step 5: Execute nudges**\n```bash\n# Use --mode=queue to avoid interrupting in-flight tool calls\ngt nudge --mode=queue \u003crig\u003e/polecats/\u003cname\u003e \"How's progress? Need help?\"\n```\n\n**Step 6: Escalate if needed**\n```bash\ngt mail send deacon/ -s \"Escalation: \u003cpolecat\u003e stuck\" \\\n  -m \"Polecat \u003cname\u003e reports stuck. Please intervene.\"\n```\n\n**Parallelism**: Use Task tool subagents to inspect multiple polecats concurrently.\n\n**ZFC Principle**: Trust agent_state from beads for WHAT agents report. But\nverify tmux session existence for WHETHER agents are alive. A dead session with\nagent_state=running is a zombie — the agent cannot correct its own state.\n\n**Step 7: ORPHANED BEAD DETECTION — Scan from beads side**\n\n🚨 **CRITICAL**: Zombie detection (Step 2a) scans FROM polecat directories.\nOnce a polecat is nuked and its directory removed, its beads become invisible\nto zombie detection. Orphaned bead detection scans FROM beads to catch this case.\n\n```bash\nbd list --status=in_progress --json --limit=0\nbd list --status=hooked --json --limit=0\n```\n\nFor each in_progress or hooked bead with a polecat assignee (format: `\u003crig\u003e/polecats/\u003cname\u003e`):\n1. Only check beads assigned to polecats in YOUR rig\n2. Check tmux session: `gt session status \u003crig\u003e/\u003cname\u003e --json | jq -r '.running'`\n3. Check polecat directory: `ls \u003crig\u003e/polecats/\u003cname\u003e 2\u003e/dev/null`\n4. If BOTH session dead AND directory missing → orphan. Reset the bead:\n   ```bash\n   bd update \u003cbead-id\u003e --status=open --assignee=\n   gt mail send deacon/ -s \"ORPHAN_RECOVERED: \u003cbead-id\u003e\" \\\n     -m \"Bead \u003cbead-id\u003e was assigned to \u003crig\u003e/polecats/\u003cname\u003e which no longer exists.\n   The bead has been reset to open with no assignee.\n   Please re-dispatch to an available polecat.\"\n   ```\n5.

They have\nno work and no state worth preserving. Nuking them immediately frees resources\nand reduces noise. Only escalate when there's actual work at risk.\n\n**Step 4: Decide action**\n\n| Observation | Action |\n|-------------|--------|\n| agent_state=running, session alive, recent activity | None |\n| agent_state=running, session alive, idle 5-15 min | Gentle nudge |\n| agent_state=running, session alive, idle 15+ min | Direct nudge with deadline |\n| agent_state=running, SESSION DEAD | ZOMBIE — handle in Step 2a |\n| agent_state=stuck | Assess and help or escalate |\n| agent_state=done | Verify cleanup triggered (see Step 4a) |\n\n**Step 4a: Handle agent_state=done**\n\nIn the ephemeral model, polecats with agent_state=done and cleanup_status=clean\nshould already be nuked by HandlePolecatDone. Finding one here indicates:\n\n1. **Stale agent bead** - polecat was nuked but bead remains\n   ```bash\n   # Verify polecat doesn't exist anymore\n   ls polecats/\u003cname\u003e 2\u003e/dev/null || echo \"Already nuked\"\n   ```\n   If nuked, the agent bead is stale. Clean it up or ignore.\n\n2. **Cleanup wisp exists** - polecat has dirty state needing intervention\n   ```bash\n   bd list --label polecat:\u003cname\u003e --status=open\n   ```\n   Process in process-cleanups step.\n\n3. **No wisp, polecat exists** - POLECAT_DONE mail was missed\n   Try auto-nuke directly (ephemeral model):\n   ```bash\n   # Check cleanup_status and nuke if clean\n   gt polecat nuke \u003cname\u003e  # Will fail if dirty\n   ```\n   If nuke fails (dirty state), create cleanup wisp for investigation.\n\n**Step 5: Execute nudges**\n```bash\n# Use --mode=queue to avoid interrupting in-flight tool calls\ngt nudge --mode=queue \u003crig\u003e/polecats/\u003cname\u003e \"How's progress? Need help?\"\n```\n\n**Step 6: Escalate if needed**\n```bash\ngt mail send deacon/ -s \"Escalation: \u003cpolecat\u003e stuck\" \\\n  -m \"Polecat \u003cname\u003e reports stuck. Please intervene.\"\n```\n\n**Parallelism**: Use Task tool subagents to inspect multiple polecats concurrently.\n\n**ZFC Principle**: Trust agent_state from beads for WHAT agents report. But\nverify tmux session existence for WHETHER agents are alive. A dead session with\nagent_state=running is a zombie — the agent cannot correct its own state.\n\n**Step 7: ORPHANED BEAD DETECTION — Scan from beads side**\n\n🚨 **CRITICAL**: Zombie detection (Step 2a) scans FROM polecat directories.\nOnce a polecat is nuked and its directory removed, its beads become invisible\nto zombie detection. Orphaned bead detection scans FROM beads to catch this case.\n\n```bash\nbd list --status=in_progress --json --limit=0\nbd list --status=hooked --json --limit=0\n```\n\nFor each in_progress or hooked bead with a polecat assignee (format: `\u003crig\u003e/polecats/\u003cname\u003e`):\n1. Only check beads assigned to polecats in YOUR rig\n2. Check tmux session: `gt session status \u003crig\u003e/\u003cname\u003e --json | jq -r '.running'`\n3. Check polecat directory: `ls \u003crig\u003e/polecats/\u003cname\u003e 2\u003e/dev/null`\n4. If BOTH session dead AND directory missing → orphan. Reset the bead:\n   ```bash\n   bd update \u003cbead-id\u003e --status=open --assignee=\n   gt mail send deacon/ -s \"ORPHAN_RECOVERED: \u003cbead-id\u003e\" \\\n     -m \"Bead \u003cbead-id\u003e was assigned to \u003crig\u003e/polecats/\u003cname\u003e which no longer exists.\n   The bead has been reset to open with no assignee.\n   Please re-dispatch to an available polecat.\"\n   ```\n5.

Check if it's safe to nuke:\n\n```bash\n# Check git status in the polecat's worktree\ncd polecats/\u003cname\u003e\ngit status --porcelain         # Should be empty (clean)\ngit log @{u}..HEAD      # Should have no unpushed commits\n```\n\n**If clean** (no uncommitted changes, no unpushed commits):\n```bash\n# Safe to nuke - no work to lose\ngt polecat nuke \u003cname\u003e\n```\nLog the auto-nuke for audit purposes. No escalation needed.\n\n**If dirty** (uncommitted or unpushed work):\n```bash\n# Escalate to Deacon - polecat has work that might be valuable\ngt mail send deacon/ -s \\\"IDLE_DIRTY: \u003cpolecat\u003e has uncommitted work\\\" \\\n  -m \\\"Polecat: \u003cname\u003e\nState: idle (no hook_bead)\nGit status: \u003cuncommitted-files\u003e\nUnpushed commits: \u003ccount\u003e\n\nPlease advise: recover work or discard?\\\"\n```\n\n**Rationale**: Idle polecats with clean git state are pure overhead. They have\nno work and no state worth preserving. Nuking them immediately frees resources\nand reduces noise. Only escalate when there's actual work at risk.\n\n**Step 4: Decide action**\n\n| Observation | Action |\n|-------------|--------|\n| agent_state=running, session alive, recent activity | None |\n| agent_state=running, session alive, idle 5-15 min | Gentle nudge |\n| agent_state=running, session alive, idle 15+ min | Direct nudge with deadline |\n| agent_state=running, SESSION DEAD | ZOMBIE — handle in Step 2a |\n| agent_state=stuck | Assess and help or escalate |\n| agent_state=done | Verify cleanup triggered (see Step 4a) |\n\n**Step 4a: Handle agent_state=done**\n\nIn the ephemeral model, polecats with agent_state=done and cleanup_status=clean\nshould already be nuked by HandlePolecatDone. Finding one here indicates:\n\n1. **Stale agent bead** - polecat was nuked but bead remains\n   ```bash\n   # Verify polecat doesn't exist anymore\n   ls polecats/\u003cname\u003e 2\u003e/dev/null || echo \"Already nuked\"\n   ```\n   If nuked, the agent bead is stale. Clean it up or ignore.\n\n2. **Cleanup wisp exists** - polecat has dirty state needing intervention\n   ```bash\n   bd list --label polecat:\u003cname\u003e --status=open\n   ```\n   Process in process-cleanups step.\n\n3. **No wisp, polecat exists** - POLECAT_DONE mail was missed\n   Try auto-nuke directly (ephemeral model):\n   ```bash\n   # Check cleanup_status and nuke if clean\n   gt polecat nuke \u003cname\u003e  # Will fail if dirty\n   ```\n   If nuke fails (dirty state), create cleanup wisp for investigation.\n\n**Step 5: Execute nudges**\n```bash\n# Use --mode=queue to avoid interrupting in-flight tool calls\ngt nudge --mode=queue \u003crig\u003e/polecats/\u003cname\u003e \"How's progress? Need help?\"\n```\n\n**Step 6: Escalate if needed**\n```bash\ngt mail send deacon/ -s \"Escalation: \u003cpolecat\u003e stuck\" \\\n  -m \"Polecat \u003cname\u003e reports stuck. Please intervene.\"\n```\n\n**Parallelism**: Use Task tool subagents to inspect multiple polecats concurrently.\n\n**ZFC Principle**: Trust agent_state from beads for WHAT agents report. But\nverify tmux session existence for WHETHER agents are alive. A dead session with\nagent_state=running is a zombie — the agent cannot correct its own state.\n\n**Step 7: ORPHANED BEAD DETECTION — Scan from beads side**\n\n🚨 **CRITICAL**: Zombie detection (Step 2a) scans FROM polecat directories.\nOnce a polecat is nuked and its directory removed, its beads become invisible\nto zombie detection. Orphaned bead detection scans FROM beads to catch this case.\n\n```bash\nbd list --status=in_progress --json --limit=0\nbd list --status=hooked --json --limit=0\n```\n\nFor each in_progress or hooked bead with a polecat assignee (format: `\u003crig\u003e/polecats/\u003cname\u003e`):\n1. Only check beads assigned to polecats in YOUR rig\n2. Check tmux session: `gt session status \u003crig\u003e/\u003cname\u003e --json | jq -r '.running'`\n3. Check polecat directory: `ls \u003crig\u003e/polecats/\u003cname\u003e 2\u003e/dev/null`\n4. If BOTH session dead AND directory missing → orphan. Reset the bead:\n   ```bash\n   bd update \u003cbead-id\u003e --status=open --assignee=\n   gt mail send deacon/ -s \"ORPHAN_RECOVERED: \u003cbead-id\u003e\" \\\n     -m \"Bead \u003cbead-id\u003e was assigned to \u003crig\u003e/polecats/\u003cname\u003e which no longer exists.\n   The bead has been reset to open with no assignee.\n   Please re-dispatch to an available polecat.\"\n   ```\n5.

Check git state to determine if work is recoverable:\n```bash\ncd polecats/\u003cname\u003e/\u003crig\u003e\ngit status --porcelain         # Uncommitted changes?\ngit log @{u}..HEAD      # Unpushed commits?\n```\n\n2. **If clean** (no uncommitted, no unpushed): Auto-nuke immediately.\n```bash\ngt polecat nuke \u003cname\u003e\n```\n\n3. **If dirty** (has unpushed/uncommitted work): Escalate to Deacon for recovery.\n```bash\ngt mail send deacon/ -s \"RECOVERY_NEEDED \u003crig\u003e/\u003cname\u003e\" \\\n  -m \"Polecat: \u003crig\u003e/\u003cname\u003e\nCleanup Status: \u003chas_uncommitted|has_unpushed|has_stash\u003e\nHook Bead: \u003chook_bead\u003e\nDetected: $(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)\n\nZombie detected: tmux session dead, agent_state=\u003cstate\u003e.\nThis polecat has unpushed/uncommitted work that will be lost if nuked.\nPlease coordinate recovery before authorizing cleanup.\"\n```\n\nAlso create a cleanup wisp for tracking:\n```bash\nbd create --ephemeral --title \"cleanup:\u003cname\u003e\" \\\n  --description \"Zombie detected: session dead, state=\u003cagent_state\u003e\" \\\n  --labels cleanup,polecat:\u003cname\u003e,state:zombie-detected\n```\n\n**Step 3: For running polecats (with LIVE session), assess progress**\n\nCheck the hook_bead field to see what they're working on:\n```bash\nbd show \u003chook_bead\u003e  # See current step/issue\n```\n\nYou can also verify they're responsive:\n```bash\ngt peek \u003crig\u003e/\u003cname\u003e 20\n```\n\nLook for:\n- Recent tool activity → making progress\n- Idle at prompt → may need nudge\n- Error messages → may need help\n\n**Step 3a: For idle polecats, auto-nuke if clean**\n\nWhen agent_state=idle, the polecat has no work assigned. Check if it's safe to nuke:\n\n```bash\n# Check git status in the polecat's worktree\ncd polecats/\u003cname\u003e\ngit status --porcelain         # Should be empty (clean)\ngit log @{u}..HEAD      # Should have no unpushed commits\n```\n\n**If clean** (no uncommitted changes, no unpushed commits):\n```bash\n# Safe to nuke - no work to lose\ngt polecat nuke \u003cname\u003e\n```\nLog the auto-nuke for audit purposes. No escalation needed.\n\n**If dirty** (uncommitted or unpushed work):\n```bash\n# Escalate to Deacon - polecat has work that might be valuable\ngt mail send deacon/ -s \\\"IDLE_DIRTY: \u003cpolecat\u003e has uncommitted work\\\" \\\n  -m \\\"Polecat: \u003cname\u003e\nState: idle (no hook_bead)\nGit status: \u003cuncommitted-files\u003e\nUnpushed commits: \u003ccount\u003e\n\nPlease advise: recover work or discard?\\\"\n```\n\n**Rationale**: Idle polecats with clean git state are pure overhead. They have\nno work and no state worth preserving. Nuking them immediately frees resources\nand reduces noise. Only escalate when there's actual work at risk.\n\n**Step 4: Decide action**\n\n| Observation | Action |\n|-------------|--------|\n| agent_state=running, session alive, recent activity | None |\n| agent_state=running, session alive, idle 5-15 min | Gentle nudge |\n| agent_state=running, session alive, idle 15+ min | Direct nudge with deadline |\n| agent_state=running, SESSION DEAD | ZOMBIE — handle in Step 2a |\n| agent_state=stuck | Assess and help or escalate |\n| agent_state=done | Verify cleanup triggered (see Step 4a) |\n\n**Step 4a: Handle agent_state=done**\n\nIn the ephemeral model, polecats with agent_state=done and cleanup_status=clean\nshould already be nuked by HandlePolecatDone. Finding one here indicates:\n\n1. **Stale agent bead** - polecat was nuked but bead remains\n   ```bash\n   # Verify polecat doesn't exist anymore\n   ls polecats/\u003cname\u003e 2\u003e/dev/null || echo \"Already nuked\"\n   ```\n   If nuked, the agent bead is stale. Clean it up or ignore.\n\n2. **Cleanup wisp exists** - polecat has dirty state needing intervention\n   ```bash\n   bd list --label polecat:\u003cname\u003e --status=open\n   ```\n   Process in process-cleanups step.\n\n3. **No wisp, polecat exists** - POLECAT_DONE mail was missed\n   Try auto-nuke directly (ephemeral model):\n   ```bash\n   # Check cleanup_status and nuke if clean\n   gt polecat nuke \u003cname\u003e  # Will fail if dirty\n   ```\n   If nuke fails (dirty state), create cleanup wisp for investigation.\n\n**Step 5: Execute nudges**\n```bash\n# Use --mode=queue to avoid interrupting in-flight tool calls\ngt nudge --mode=queue \u003crig\u003e/polecats/\u003cname\u003e \"How's progress? Need help?\"\n```\n\n**Step 6: Escalate if needed**\n```bash\ngt mail send deacon/ -s \"Escalation: \u003cpolecat\u003e stuck\" \\\n  -m \"Polecat \u003cname\u003e reports stuck. Please intervene.\"\n```\n\n**Parallelism**: Use Task tool subagents to inspect multiple polecats concurrently.\n\n**ZFC Principle**: Trust agent_state from beads for WHAT agents report. But\nverify tmux session existence for WHETHER agents are alive. A dead session with\nagent_state=running is a zombie — the agent cannot correct its own state.\n\n**Step 7: ORPHANED BEAD DETECTION — Scan from beads side**\n\n🚨 **CRITICAL**: Zombie detection (Step 2a) scans FROM polecat directories.\nOnce a polecat is nuked and its directory removed, its beads become invisible\nto zombie detection. Orphaned bead detection scans FROM beads to catch this case.\n\n```bash\nbd list --status=in_progress --json --limit=0\nbd list --status=hooked --json --limit=0\n```\n\nFor each in_progress or hooked bead with a polecat assignee (format: `\u003crig\u003e/polecats/\u003cname\u003e`):\n1. Only check beads assigned to polecats in YOUR rig\n2. Check tmux session: `gt session status \u003crig\u003e/\u003cname\u003e --json | jq -r '.running'`\n3. Check polecat directory: `ls \u003crig\u003e/polecats/\u003cname\u003e 2\u003e/dev/null`\n4. If BOTH session dead AND directory missing → orphan. Reset the bead:\n   ```bash\n   bd update \u003cbead-id\u003e --status=open --assignee=\n   gt mail send deacon/ -s \"ORPHAN_RECOVERED: \u003cbead-id\u003e\" \\\n     -m \"Bead \u003cbead-id\u003e was assigned to \u003crig\u003e/polecats/\u003cname\u003e which no longer exists.\n   The bead has been reset to open with no assignee.\n   Please re-dispatch to an available polecat.\"\n   ```\n5. If directory exists but session dead → skip (zombie detection handles it)\n6.

The source branch may have been deleted while the MR bead is still open.\n  These likely need to be closed or investigated.\n\n- **Queue depth**: A large number of unclaimed MRs may indicate the refinery is down\n  or overwhelmed.

Check if it's safe to nuke:\n\n```bash\n# Check git status in the polecat's worktree\ncd polecats/\u003cname\u003e\ngit status --porcelain         # Should be empty (clean)\ngit log @{u}..HEAD      # Should have no unpushed commits\n```\n\n**If clean** (no uncommitted changes, no unpushed commits):\n```bash\n# Safe to nuke - no work to lose\ngt polecat nuke \u003cname\u003e\n```\nLog the auto-nuke for audit purposes. No escalation needed.\n\n**If dirty** (uncommitted or unpushed work):\n```bash\n# Escalate to Deacon - polecat has work that might be valuable\ngt mail send deacon/ -s \\\"IDLE_DIRTY: \u003cpolecat\u003e has uncommitted work\\\" \\\n  -m \\\"Polecat: \u003cname\u003e\nState: idle (no hook_bead)\nGit status: \u003cuncommitted-files\u003e\nUnpushed commits: \u003ccount\u003e\n\nPlease advise: recover work or discard?\\\"\n```\n\n**Rationale**: Idle polecats with clean git state are pure overhead. They have\nno work and no state worth preserving. Nuking them immediately frees resources\nand reduces noise. Only escalate when there's actual work at risk.\n\n**Step 4: Decide action**\n\n| Observation | Action |\n|-------------|--------|\n| agent_state=running, session alive, recent activity | None |\n| agent_state=running, session alive, idle 5-15 min | Gentle nudge |\n| agent_state=running, session alive, idle 15+ min | Direct nudge with deadline |\n| agent_state=running, SESSION DEAD | ZOMBIE — handle in Step 2a |\n| agent_state=stuck | Assess and help or escalate |\n| agent_state=done | Verify cleanup triggered (see Step 4a) |\n\n**Step 4a: Handle agent_state=done**\n\nIn the ephemeral model, polecats with agent_state=done and cleanup_status=clean\nshould already be nuked by HandlePolecatDone. Finding one here indicates:\n\n1. **Stale agent bead** - polecat was nuked but bead remains\n   ```bash\n   # Verify polecat doesn't exist anymore\n   ls polecats/\u003cname\u003e 2\u003e/dev/null || echo \"Already nuked\"\n   ```\n   If nuked, the agent bead is stale. Clean it up or ignore.\n\n2. **Cleanup wisp exists** - polecat has dirty state needing intervention\n   ```bash\n   bd list --label polecat:\u003cname\u003e --status=open\n   ```\n   Process in process-cleanups step.\n\n3. **No wisp, polecat exists** - POLECAT_DONE mail was missed\n   Try auto-nuke directly (ephemeral model):\n   ```bash\n   # Check cleanup_status and nuke if clean\n   gt polecat nuke \u003cname\u003e  # Will fail if dirty\n   ```\n   If nuke fails (dirty state), create cleanup wisp for investigation.\n\n**Step 5: Execute nudges**\n```bash\n# Use --mode=queue to avoid interrupting in-flight tool calls\ngt nudge --mode=queue \u003crig\u003e/polecats/\u003cname\u003e \"How's progress? Need help?\"\n```\n\n**Step 6: Escalate if needed**\n```bash\ngt mail send deacon/ -s \"Escalation: \u003cpolecat\u003e stuck\" \\\n  -m \"Polecat \u003cname\u003e reports stuck. Please intervene.\"\n```\n\n**Parallelism**: Use Task tool subagents to inspect multiple polecats concurrently.\n\n**ZFC Principle**: Trust agent_state from beads for WHAT agents report. But\nverify tmux session existence for WHETHER agents are alive. A dead session with\nagent_state=running is a zombie — the agent cannot correct its own state.\n\n**Step 7: ORPHANED BEAD DETECTION — Scan from beads side**\n\n🚨 **CRITICAL**: Zombie detection (Step 2a) scans FROM polecat directories.\nOnce a polecat is nuked and its directory removed, its beads become invisible\nto zombie detection. Orphaned bead detection scans FROM beads to catch this case.\n\n```bash\nbd list --status=in_progress --json --limit=0\nbd list --status=hooked --json --limit=0\n```\n\nFor each in_progress or hooked bead with a polecat assignee (format: `\u003crig\u003e/polecats/\u003cname\u003e`):\n1. Only check beads assigned to polecats in YOUR rig\n2. Check tmux session: `gt session status \u003crig\u003e/\u003cname\u003e --json | jq -r '.running'`\n3. Check polecat directory: `ls \u003crig\u003e/polecats/\u003cname\u003e 2\u003e/dev/null`\n4. If BOTH session dead AND directory missing → orphan. Reset the bead:\n   ```bash\n   bd update \u003cbead-id\u003e --status=open --assignee=\n   gt mail send deacon/ -s \"ORPHAN_RECOVERED: \u003cbead-id\u003e\" \\\n     -m \"Bead \u003cbead-id\u003e was assigned to \u003crig\u003e/polecats/\u003cname\u003e which no longer exists.\n   The bead has been reset to open with no assignee.\n   Please re-dispatch to an available polecat.\"\n   ```\n5. If directory exists but session dead → skip (zombie detection handles it)\n6.

A polecat with agent_state=running\nor hook_bead assigned but NO tmux session is a zombie that will sit forever\nundetected unless you proactively check.\n\nFor EVERY polecat with agent_state=running/working OR hook_bead assigned:\n```bash\ngt session status \u003crig\u003e/\u003cname\u003e --json | jq -r '.running' | grep -q true \u0026\u0026 echo ALIVE || echo ZOMBIE\n```\n\n**If ZOMBIE detected** (session missing, agent says working):\n\n1.

Check if it's safe to nuke:\n\n```bash\n# Check git status in the polecat's worktree\ncd polecats/\u003cname\u003e\ngit status --porcelain         # Should be empty (clean)\ngit log @{u}..HEAD      # Should have no unpushed commits\n```\n\n**If clean** (no uncommitted changes, no unpushed commits):\n```bash\n# Safe to nuke - no work to lose\ngt polecat nuke \u003cname\u003e\n```\nLog the auto-nuke for audit purposes. No escalation needed.\n\n**If dirty** (uncommitted or unpushed work):\n```bash\n# Escalate to Deacon - polecat has work that might be valuable\ngt mail send deacon/ -s \\\"IDLE_DIRTY: \u003cpolecat\u003e has uncommitted work\\\" \\\n  -m \\\"Polecat: \u003cname\u003e\nState: idle (no hook_bead)\nGit status: \u003cuncommitted-files\u003e\nUnpushed commits: \u003ccount\u003e\n\nPlease advise: recover work or discard?\\\"\n```\n\n**Rationale**: Idle polecats with clean git state are pure overhead. They have\nno work and no state worth preserving. Nuking them immediately frees resources\nand reduces noise. Only escalate when there's actual work at risk.\n\n**Step 4: Decide action**\n\n| Observation | Action |\n|-------------|--------|\n| agent_state=running, session alive, recent activity | None |\n| agent_state=running, session alive, idle 5-15 min | Gentle nudge |\n| agent_state=running, session alive, idle 15+ min | Direct nudge with deadline |\n| agent_state=running, SESSION DEAD | ZOMBIE — handle in Step 2a |\n| agent_state=stuck | Assess and help or escalate |\n| agent_state=done | Verify cleanup triggered (see Step 4a) |\n\n**Step 4a: Handle agent_state=done**\n\nIn the ephemeral model, polecats with agent_state=done and cleanup_status=clean\nshould already be nuked by HandlePolecatDone. Finding one here indicates:\n\n1. **Stale agent bead** - polecat was nuked but bead remains\n   ```bash\n   # Verify polecat doesn't exist anymore\n   ls polecats/\u003cname\u003e 2\u003e/dev/null || echo \"Already nuked\"\n   ```\n   If nuked, the agent bead is stale. Clean it up or ignore.\n\n2. **Cleanup wisp exists** - polecat has dirty state needing intervention\n   ```bash\n   bd list --label polecat:\u003cname\u003e --status=open\n   ```\n   Process in process-cleanups step.\n\n3. **No wisp, polecat exists** - POLECAT_DONE mail was missed\n   Try auto-nuke directly (ephemeral model):\n   ```bash\n   # Check cleanup_status and nuke if clean\n   gt polecat nuke \u003cname\u003e  # Will fail if dirty\n   ```\n   If nuke fails (dirty state), create cleanup wisp for investigation.\n\n**Step 5: Execute nudges**\n```bash\n# Use --mode=queue to avoid interrupting in-flight tool calls\ngt nudge --mode=queue \u003crig\u003e/polecats/\u003cname\u003e \"How's progress? Need help?\"\n```\n\n**Step 6: Escalate if needed**\n```bash\ngt mail send deacon/ -s \"Escalation: \u003cpolecat\u003e stuck\" \\\n  -m \"Polecat \u003cname\u003e reports stuck. Please intervene.\"\n```\n\n**Parallelism**: Use Task tool subagents to inspect multiple polecats concurrently.\n\n**ZFC Principle**: Trust agent_state from beads for WHAT agents report. But\nverify tmux session existence for WHETHER agents are alive. A dead session with\nagent_state=running is a zombie — the agent cannot correct its own state.\n\n**Step 7: ORPHANED BEAD DETECTION — Scan from beads side**\n\n🚨 **CRITICAL**: Zombie detection (Step 2a) scans FROM polecat directories.\nOnce a polecat is nuked and its directory removed, its beads become invisible\nto zombie detection. Orphaned bead detection scans FROM beads to catch this case.\n\n```bash\nbd list --status=in_progress --json --limit=0\nbd list --status=hooked --json --limit=0\n```\n\nFor each in_progress or hooked bead with a polecat assignee (format: `\u003crig\u003e/polecats/\u003cname\u003e`):\n1. Only check beads assigned to polecats in YOUR rig\n2. Check tmux session: `gt session status \u003crig\u003e/\u003cname\u003e --json | jq -r '.running'`\n3. Check polecat directory: `ls \u003crig\u003e/polecats/\u003cname\u003e 2\u003e/dev/null`\n4. If BOTH session dead AND directory missing → orphan. Reset the bead:\n   ```bash\n   bd update \u003cbead-id\u003e --status=open --assignee=\n   gt mail send deacon/ -s \"ORPHAN_RECOVERED: \u003cbead-id\u003e\" \\\n     -m \"Bead \u003cbead-id\u003e was assigned to \u003crig\u003e/polecats/\u003cname\u003e which no longer exists.\n   The bead has been reset to open with no assignee.\n   Please re-dispatch to an available polecat.\"\n   ```\n5. If directory exists but session dead → skip (zombie detection handles it)\n6.

Check if it's safe to nuke:\n\n```bash\n# Check git status in the polecat's worktree\ncd polecats/\u003cname\u003e\ngit status --porcelain         # Should be empty (clean)\ngit log @{u}..HEAD      # Should have no unpushed commits\n```\n\n**If clean** (no uncommitted changes, no unpushed commits):\n```bash\n# Safe to nuke - no work to lose\ngt polecat nuke \u003cname\u003e\n```\nLog the auto-nuke for audit purposes. No escalation needed.\n\n**If dirty** (uncommitted or unpushed work):\n```bash\n# Escalate to Deacon - polecat has work that might be valuable\ngt mail send deacon/ -s \\\"IDLE_DIRTY: \u003cpolecat\u003e has uncommitted work\\\" \\\n  -m \\\"Polecat: \u003cname\u003e\nState: idle (no hook_bead)\nGit status: \u003cuncommitted-files\u003e\nUnpushed commits: \u003ccount\u003e\n\nPlease advise: recover work or discard?\\\"\n```\n\n**Rationale**: Idle polecats with clean git state are pure overhead. They have\nno work and no state worth preserving. Nuking them immediately frees resources\nand reduces noise. Only escalate when there's actual work at risk.\n\n**Step 4: Decide action**\n\n| Observation | Action |\n|-------------|--------|\n| agent_state=running, session alive, recent activity | None |\n| agent_state=running, session alive, idle 5-15 min | Gentle nudge |\n| agent_state=running, session alive, idle 15+ min | Direct nudge with deadline |\n| agent_state=running, SESSION DEAD | ZOMBIE — handle in Step 2a |\n| agent_state=stuck | Assess and help or escalate |\n| agent_state=done | Verify cleanup triggered (see Step 4a) |\n\n**Step 4a: Handle agent_state=done**\n\nIn the ephemeral model, polecats with agent_state=done and cleanup_status=clean\nshould already be nuked by HandlePolecatDone. Finding one here indicates:\n\n1. **Stale agent bead** - polecat was nuked but bead remains\n   ```bash\n   # Verify polecat doesn't exist anymore\n   ls polecats/\u003cname\u003e 2\u003e/dev/null || echo \"Already nuked\"\n   ```\n   If nuked, the agent bead is stale. Clean it up or ignore.\n\n2. **Cleanup wisp exists** - polecat has dirty state needing intervention\n   ```bash\n   bd list --label polecat:\u003cname\u003e --status=open\n   ```\n   Process in process-cleanups step.\n\n3. **No wisp, polecat exists** - POLECAT_DONE mail was missed\n   Try auto-nuke directly (ephemeral model):\n   ```bash\n   # Check cleanup_status and nuke if clean\n   gt polecat nuke \u003cname\u003e  # Will fail if dirty\n   ```\n   If nuke fails (dirty state), create cleanup wisp for investigation.\n\n**Step 5: Execute nudges**\n```bash\n# Use --mode=queue to avoid interrupting in-flight tool calls\ngt nudge --mode=queue \u003crig\u003e/polecats/\u003cname\u003e \"How's progress? Need help?\"\n```\n\n**Step 6: Escalate if needed**\n```bash\ngt mail send deacon/ -s \"Escalation: \u003cpolecat\u003e stuck\" \\\n  -m \"Polecat \u003cname\u003e reports stuck. Please intervene.\"\n```\n\n**Parallelism**: Use Task tool subagents to inspect multiple polecats concurrently.\n\n**ZFC Principle**: Trust agent_state from beads for WHAT agents report. But\nverify tmux session existence for WHETHER agents are alive. A dead session with\nagent_state=running is a zombie — the agent cannot correct its own state.\n\n**Step 7: ORPHANED BEAD DETECTION — Scan from beads side**\n\n🚨 **CRITICAL**: Zombie detection (Step 2a) scans FROM polecat directories.\nOnce a polecat is nuked and its directory removed, its beads become invisible\nto zombie detection. Orphaned bead detection scans FROM beads to catch this case.\n\n```bash\nbd list --status=in_progress --json --limit=0\nbd list --status=hooked --json --limit=0\n```\n\nFor each in_progress or hooked bead with a polecat assignee (format: `\u003crig\u003e/polecats/\u003cname\u003e`):\n1. Only check beads assigned to polecats in YOUR rig\n2. Check tmux session: `gt session status \u003crig\u003e/\u003cname\u003e --json | jq -r '.running'`\n3. Check polecat directory: `ls \u003crig\u003e/polecats/\u003cname\u003e 2\u003e/dev/null`\n4. If BOTH session dead AND directory missing → orphan. Reset the bead:\n   ```bash\n   bd update \u003cbead-id\u003e --status=open --assignee=\n   gt mail send deacon/ -s \"ORPHAN_RECOVERED: \u003cbead-id\u003e\" \\\n     -m \"Bead \u003cbead-id\u003e was assigned to \u003crig\u003e/polecats/\u003cname\u003e which no longer exists.\n   The bead has been reset to open with no assignee.\n   Please re-dispatch to an available polecat.\"\n   ```\n5. If directory exists but session dead → skip (zombie detection handles it)\n6.

Check cleanup_status from agent bead\n2. If \"clean\" (branch pushed): AUTO-NUKE immediately, archive mail\n3. If dirty: Create cleanup wisp for manual intervention\n\n```bash\n# The handler does this automatically:\n# - For clean state: gt polecat nuke \u003cname\u003e → archive mail\n# - For dirty state: create wisp → process in next step\n```\n\nCleanup wisps are only created when something is wrong (uncommitted changes,\nunpushed commits). Most POLECAT_DONE messages result in immediate nuke.\n\n**MERGED**:\nA branch was merged successfully. This is informational in the ephemeral model\nsince the polecat was already nuked after MR submission.\n\nIf a cleanup wisp exists (dirty state), complete the cleanup:\n```bash\n# Find the cleanup wisp for this polecat\nbd list --label polecat:\u003cname\u003e,state:merge-requested --status=open\n\n# If found, proceed with full polecat nuke:\ngt polecat nuke \u003cname\u003e\n\n# Burn the cleanup wisp\nbd close \u003cwisp-id\u003e\n```\nArchive after cleanup is complete.\n\n**HELP / Blocked**:\nAssess the request. Can you help? If not, escalate to Deacon:\n```bash\ngt mail send deacon/ -s \"Escalation: \u003cpolecat\u003e needs help\" -m \"\u003cdetails\u003e\"\n```\nArchive after handling (escalated or resolved):\n```bash\ngt mail archive \u003cmessage-id\u003e\n```\n\n**HANDOFF**:\nRead predecessor context. Continue from where they left off.\nArchive after absorbing context:\n```bash\ngt mail archive \u003cmessage-id\u003e\n```\n\n**SWARM_START**:\nMayor initiating batch polecat work.

Check if it's safe to nuke:\n\n```bash\n# Check git status in the polecat's worktree\ncd polecats/\u003cname\u003e\ngit status --porcelain         # Should be empty (clean)\ngit log @{u}..HEAD      # Should have no unpushed commits\n```\n\n**If clean** (no uncommitted changes, no unpushed commits):\n```bash\n# Safe to nuke - no work to lose\ngt polecat nuke \u003cname\u003e\n```\nLog the auto-nuke for audit purposes. No escalation needed.\n\n**If dirty** (uncommitted or unpushed work):\n```bash\n# Escalate to Deacon - polecat has work that might be valuable\ngt mail send deacon/ -s \\\"IDLE_DIRTY: \u003cpolecat\u003e has uncommitted work\\\" \\\n  -m \\\"Polecat: \u003cname\u003e\nState: idle (no hook_bead)\nGit status: \u003cuncommitted-files\u003e\nUnpushed commits: \u003ccount\u003e\n\nPlease advise: recover work or discard?\\\"\n```\n\n**Rationale**: Idle polecats with clean git state are pure overhead. They have\nno work and no state worth preserving. Nuking them immediately frees resources\nand reduces noise. Only escalate when there's actual work at risk.\n\n**Step 4: Decide action**\n\n| Observation | Action |\n|-------------|--------|\n| agent_state=running, session alive, recent activity | None |\n| agent_state=running, session alive, idle 5-15 min | Gentle nudge |\n| agent_state=running, session alive, idle 15+ min | Direct nudge with deadline |\n| agent_state=running, SESSION DEAD | ZOMBIE — handle in Step 2a |\n| agent_state=stuck | Assess and help or escalate |\n| agent_state=done | Verify cleanup triggered (see Step 4a) |\n\n**Step 4a: Handle agent_state=done**\n\nIn the ephemeral model, polecats with agent_state=done and cleanup_status=clean\nshould already be nuked by HandlePolecatDone. Finding one here indicates:\n\n1. **Stale agent bead** - polecat was nuked but bead remains\n   ```bash\n   # Verify polecat doesn't exist anymore\n   ls polecats/\u003cname\u003e 2\u003e/dev/null || echo \"Already nuked\"\n   ```\n   If nuked, the agent bead is stale. Clean it up or ignore.\n\n2. **Cleanup wisp exists** - polecat has dirty state needing intervention\n   ```bash\n   bd list --label polecat:\u003cname\u003e --status=open\n   ```\n   Process in process-cleanups step.\n\n3. **No wisp, polecat exists** - POLECAT_DONE mail was missed\n   Try auto-nuke directly (ephemeral model):\n   ```bash\n   # Check cleanup_status and nuke if clean\n   gt polecat nuke \u003cname\u003e  # Will fail if dirty\n   ```\n   If nuke fails (dirty state), create cleanup wisp for investigation.\n\n**Step 5: Execute nudges**\n```bash\n# Use --mode=queue to avoid interrupting in-flight tool calls\ngt nudge --mode=queue \u003crig\u003e/polecats/\u003cname\u003e \"How's progress? Need help?\"\n```\n\n**Step 6: Escalate if needed**\n```bash\ngt mail send deacon/ -s \"Escalation: \u003cpolecat\u003e stuck\" \\\n  -m \"Polecat \u003cname\u003e reports stuck. Please intervene.\"\n```\n\n**Parallelism**: Use Task tool subagents to inspect multiple polecats concurrently.\n\n**ZFC Principle**: Trust agent_state from beads for WHAT agents report. But\nverify tmux session existence for WHETHER agents are alive. A dead session with\nagent_state=running is a zombie — the agent cannot correct its own state.\n\n**Step 7: ORPHANED BEAD DETECTION — Scan from beads side**\n\n🚨 **CRITICAL**: Zombie detection (Step 2a) scans FROM polecat directories.\nOnce a polecat is nuked and its directory removed, its beads become invisible\nto zombie detection. Orphaned bead detection scans FROM beads to catch this case.\n\n```bash\nbd list --status=in_progress --json --limit=0\nbd list --status=hooked --json --limit=0\n```\n\nFor each in_progress or hooked bead with a polecat assignee (format: `\u003crig\u003e/polecats/\u003cname\u003e`):\n1. Only check beads assigned to polecats in YOUR rig\n2. Check tmux session: `gt session status \u003crig\u003e/\u003cname\u003e --json | jq -r '.running'`\n3. Check polecat directory: `ls \u003crig\u003e/polecats/\u003cname\u003e 2\u003e/dev/null`\n4. If BOTH session dead AND directory missing → orphan.

A polecat with agent_state=running\nor hook_bead assigned but NO tmux session is a zombie that will sit forever\nundetected unless you proactively check.\n\nFor EVERY polecat with agent_state=running/working OR hook_bead assigned:\n```bash\ngt session status \u003crig\u003e/\u003cname\u003e --json | jq -r '.running' | grep -q true \u0026\u0026 echo ALIVE || echo ZOMBIE\n```\n\n**If ZOMBIE detected** (session missing, agent says working):\n\n1. Check git state to determine if work is recoverable:\n```bash\ncd polecats/\u003cname\u003e/\u003crig\u003e\ngit status --porcelain         # Uncommitted changes?\ngit log @{u}..HEAD      # Unpushed commits?\n```\n\n2. **If clean** (no uncommitted, no unpushed): Auto-nuke immediately.\n```bash\ngt polecat nuke \u003cname\u003e\n```\n\n3. **If dirty** (has unpushed/uncommitted work): Escalate to Deacon for recovery.\n```bash\ngt mail send deacon/ -s \"RECOVERY_NEEDED \u003crig\u003e/\u003cname\u003e\" \\\n  -m \"Polecat: \u003crig\u003e/\u003cname\u003e\nCleanup Status: \u003chas_uncommitted|has_unpushed|has_stash\u003e\nHook Bead: \u003chook_bead\u003e\nDetected: $(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)\n\nZombie detected: tmux session dead, agent_state=\u003cstate\u003e.\nThis polecat has unpushed/uncommitted work that will be lost if nuked.\nPlease coordinate recovery before authorizing cleanup.\"\n```\n\nAlso create a cleanup wisp for tracking:\n```bash\nbd create --ephemeral --title \"cleanup:\u003cname\u003e\" \\\n  --description \"Zombie detected: session dead, state=\u003cagent_state\u003e\" \\\n  --labels cleanup,polecat:\u003cname\u003e,state:zombie-detected\n```\n\n**Step 3: For running polecats (with LIVE session), assess progress**\n\nCheck the hook_bead field to see what they're working on:\n```bash\nbd show \u003chook_bead\u003e  # See current step/issue\n```\n\nYou can also verify they're responsive:\n```bash\ngt peek \u003crig\u003e/\u003cname\u003e 20\n```\n\nLook for:\n- Recent tool activity → making progress\n- Idle at prompt → may need nudge\n- Error messages → may need help\n\n**Step 3a: For idle polecats, auto-nuke if clean**\n\nWhen agent_state=idle, the polecat has no work assigned. Check if it's safe to nuke:\n\n```bash\n# Check git status in the polecat's worktree\ncd polecats/\u003cname\u003e\ngit status --porcelain         # Should be empty (clean)\ngit log @{u}..HEAD      # Should have no unpushed commits\n```\n\n**If clean** (no uncommitted changes, no unpushed commits):\n```bash\n# Safe to nuke - no work to lose\ngt polecat nuke \u003cname\u003e\n```\nLog the auto-nuke for audit purposes. No escalation needed.\n\n**If dirty** (uncommitted or unpushed work):\n```bash\n# Escalate to Deacon - polecat has work that might be valuable\ngt mail send deacon/ -s \\\"IDLE_DIRTY: \u003cpolecat\u003e has uncommitted work\\\" \\\n  -m \\\"Polecat: \u003cname\u003e\nState: idle (no hook_bead)\nGit status: \u003cuncommitted-files\u003e\nUnpushed commits: \u003ccount\u003e\n\nPlease advise: recover work or discard?\\\"\n```\n\n**Rationale**: Idle polecats with clean git state are pure overhead. They have\nno work and no state worth preserving. Nuking them immediately frees resources\nand reduces noise. Only escalate when there's actual work at risk.\n\n**Step 4: Decide action**\n\n| Observation | Action |\n|-------------|--------|\n| agent_state=running, session alive, recent activity | None |\n| agent_state=running, session alive, idle 5-15 min | Gentle nudge |\n| agent_state=running, session alive, idle 15+ min | Direct nudge with deadline |\n| agent_state=running, SESSION DEAD | ZOMBIE — handle in Step 2a |\n| agent_state=stuck | Assess and help or escalate |\n| agent_state=done | Verify cleanup triggered (see Step 4a) |\n\n**Step 4a: Handle agent_state=done**\n\nIn the ephemeral model, polecats with agent_state=done and cleanup_status=clean\nshould already be nuked by HandlePolecatDone. Finding one here indicates:\n\n1. **Stale agent bead** - polecat was nuked but bead remains\n   ```bash\n   # Verify polecat doesn't exist anymore\n   ls polecats/\u003cname\u003e 2\u003e/dev/null || echo \"Already nuked\"\n   ```\n   If nuked, the agent bead is stale. Clean it up or ignore.\n\n2. **Cleanup wisp exists** - polecat has dirty state needing intervention\n   ```bash\n   bd list --label polecat:\u003cname\u003e --status=open\n   ```\n   Process in process-cleanups step.\n\n3. **No wisp, polecat exists** - POLECAT_DONE mail was missed\n   Try auto-nuke directly (ephemeral model):\n   ```bash\n   # Check cleanup_status and nuke if clean\n   gt polecat nuke \u003cname\u003e  # Will fail if dirty\n   ```\n   If nuke fails (dirty state), create cleanup wisp for investigation.\n\n**Step 5: Execute nudges**\n```bash\n# Use --mode=queue to avoid interrupting in-flight tool calls\ngt nudge --mode=queue \u003crig\u003e/polecats/\u003cname\u003e \"How's progress? Need help?\"\n```\n\n**Step 6: Escalate if needed**\n```bash\ngt mail send deacon/ -s \"Escalation: \u003cpolecat\u003e stuck\" \\\n  -m \"Polecat \u003cname\u003e reports stuck. Please intervene.\"\n```\n\n**Parallelism**: Use Task tool subagents to inspect multiple polecats concurrently.\n\n**ZFC Principle**: Trust agent_state from beads for WHAT agents report. But\nverify tmux session existence for WHETHER agents are alive. A dead session with\nagent_state=running is a zombie — the agent cannot correct its own state.\n\n**Step 7: ORPHANED BEAD DETECTION — Scan from beads side**\n\n🚨 **CRITICAL**: Zombie detection (Step 2a) scans FROM polecat directories.\nOnce a polecat is nuked and its directory removed, its beads become invisible\nto zombie detection. Orphaned bead detection scans FROM beads to catch this case.\n\n```bash\nbd list --status=in_progress --json --limit=0\nbd list --status=hooked --json --limit=0\n```\n\nFor each in_progress or hooked bead with a polecat assignee (format: `\u003crig\u003e/polecats/\u003cname\u003e`):\n1. Only check beads assigned to polecats in YOUR rig\n2. Check tmux session: `gt session status \u003crig\u003e/\u003cname\u003e --json | jq -r '.running'`\n3. Check polecat directory: `ls \u003crig\u003e/polecats/\u003cname\u003e 2\u003e/dev/null`\n4. If BOTH session dead AND directory missing → orphan. Reset the bead:\n   ```bash\n   bd update \u003cbead-id\u003e --status=open --assignee=\n   gt mail send deacon/ -s \"ORPHAN_RECOVERED: \u003cbead-id\u003e\" \\\n     -m \"Bead \u003cbead-id\u003e was assigned to \u003crig\u003e/polecats/\u003cname\u003e which no longer exists.\n   The bead has been reset to open with no assignee.\n   Please re-dispatch to an available polecat.\"\n   ```\n5.

A polecat with agent_state=running\nor hook_bead assigned but NO tmux session is a zombie that will sit forever\nundetected unless you proactively check.\n\nFor EVERY polecat with agent_state=running/working OR hook_bead assigned:\n```bash\ngt session status \u003crig\u003e/\u003cname\u003e --json | jq -r '.running' | grep -q true \u0026\u0026 echo ALIVE || echo ZOMBIE\n```\n\n**If ZOMBIE detected** (session missing, agent says working):\n\n1. Check git state to determine if work is recoverable:\n```bash\ncd polecats/\u003cname\u003e/\u003crig\u003e\ngit status --porcelain         # Uncommitted changes?\ngit log @{u}..HEAD      # Unpushed commits?\n```\n\n2. **If clean** (no uncommitted, no unpushed): Auto-nuke immediately.\n```bash\ngt polecat nuke \u003cname\u003e\n```\n\n3. **If dirty** (has unpushed/uncommitted work): Escalate to Deacon for recovery.\n```bash\ngt mail send deacon/ -s \"RECOVERY_NEEDED \u003crig\u003e/\u003cname\u003e\" \\\n  -m \"Polecat: \u003crig\u003e/\u003cname\u003e\nCleanup Status: \u003chas_uncommitted|has_unpushed|has_stash\u003e\nHook Bead: \u003chook_bead\u003e\nDetected: $(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)\n\nZombie detected: tmux session dead, agent_state=\u003cstate\u003e.\nThis polecat has unpushed/uncommitted work that will be lost if nuked.\nPlease coordinate recovery before authorizing cleanup.\"\n```\n\nAlso create a cleanup wisp for tracking:\n```bash\nbd create --ephemeral --title \"cleanup:\u003cname\u003e\" \\\n  --description \"Zombie detected: session dead, state=\u003cagent_state\u003e\" \\\n  --labels cleanup,polecat:\u003cname\u003e,state:zombie-detected\n```\n\n**Step 3: For running polecats (with LIVE session), assess progress**\n\nCheck the hook_bead field to see what they're working on:\n```bash\nbd show \u003chook_bead\u003e  # See current step/issue\n```\n\nYou can also verify they're responsive:\n```bash\ngt peek \u003crig\u003e/\u003cname\u003e 20\n```\n\nLook for:\n- Recent tool activity → making progress\n- Idle at prompt → may need nudge\n- Error messages → may need help\n\n**Step 3a: For idle polecats, auto-nuke if clean**\n\nWhen agent_state=idle, the polecat has no work assigned. Check if it's safe to nuke:\n\n```bash\n# Check git status in the polecat's worktree\ncd polecats/\u003cname\u003e\ngit status --porcelain         # Should be empty (clean)\ngit log @{u}..HEAD      # Should have no unpushed commits\n```\n\n**If clean** (no uncommitted changes, no unpushed commits):\n```bash\n# Safe to nuke - no work to lose\ngt polecat nuke \u003cname\u003e\n```\nLog the auto-nuke for audit purposes. No escalation needed.\n\n**If dirty** (uncommitted or unpushed work):\n```bash\n# Escalate to Deacon - polecat has work that might be valuable\ngt mail send deacon/ -s \\\"IDLE_DIRTY: \u003cpolecat\u003e has uncommitted work\\\" \\\n  -m \\\"Polecat: \u003cname\u003e\nState: idle (no hook_bead)\nGit status: \u003cuncommitted-files\u003e\nUnpushed commits: \u003ccount\u003e\n\nPlease advise: recover work or discard?\\\"\n```\n\n**Rationale**: Idle polecats with clean git state are pure overhead. They have\nno work and no state worth preserving. Nuking them immediately frees resources\nand reduces noise. Only escalate when there's actual work at risk.\n\n**Step 4: Decide action**\n\n| Observation | Action |\n|-------------|--------|\n| agent_state=running, session alive, recent activity | None |\n| agent_state=running, session alive, idle 5-15 min | Gentle nudge |\n| agent_state=running, session alive, idle 15+ min | Direct nudge with deadline |\n| agent_state=running, SESSION DEAD | ZOMBIE — handle in Step 2a |\n| agent_state=stuck | Assess and help or escalate |\n| agent_state=done | Verify cleanup triggered (see Step 4a) |\n\n**Step 4a: Handle agent_state=done**\n\nIn the ephemeral model, polecats with agent_state=done and cleanup_status=clean\nshould already be nuked by HandlePolecatDone. Finding one here indicates:\n\n1. **Stale agent bead** - polecat was nuked but bead remains\n   ```bash\n   # Verify polecat doesn't exist anymore\n   ls polecats/\u003cname\u003e 2\u003e/dev/null || echo \"Already nuked\"\n   ```\n   If nuked, the agent bead is stale. Clean it up or ignore.\n\n2. **Cleanup wisp exists** - polecat has dirty state needing intervention\n   ```bash\n   bd list --label polecat:\u003cname\u003e --status=open\n   ```\n   Process in process-cleanups step.\n\n3. **No wisp, polecat exists** - POLECAT_DONE mail was missed\n   Try auto-nuke directly (ephemeral model):\n   ```bash\n   # Check cleanup_status and nuke if clean\n   gt polecat nuke \u003cname\u003e  # Will fail if dirty\n   ```\n   If nuke fails (dirty state), create cleanup wisp for investigation.\n\n**Step 5: Execute nudges**\n```bash\n# Use --mode=queue to avoid interrupting in-flight tool calls\ngt nudge --mode=queue \u003crig\u003e/polecats/\u003cname\u003e \"How's progress? Need help?\"\n```\n\n**Step 6: Escalate if needed**\n```bash\ngt mail send deacon/ -s \"Escalation: \u003cpolecat\u003e stuck\" \\\n  -m \"Polecat \u003cname\u003e reports stuck. Please intervene.\"\n```\n\n**Parallelism**: Use Task tool subagents to inspect multiple polecats concurrently.\n\n**ZFC Principle**: Trust agent_state from beads for WHAT agents report. But\nverify tmux session existence for WHETHER agents are alive. A dead session with\nagent_state=running is a zombie — the agent cannot correct its own state.\n\n**Step 7: ORPHANED BEAD DETECTION — Scan from beads side**\n\n🚨 **CRITICAL**: Zombie detection (Step 2a) scans FROM polecat directories.\nOnce a polecat is nuked and its directory removed, its beads become invisible\nto zombie detection. Orphaned bead detection scans FROM beads to catch this case.\n\n```bash\nbd list --status=in_progress --json --limit=0\nbd list --status=hooked --json --limit=0\n```\n\nFor each in_progress or hooked bead with a polecat assignee (format: `\u003crig\u003e/polecats/\u003cname\u003e`):\n1. Only check beads assigned to polecats in YOUR rig\n2. Check tmux session: `gt session status \u003crig\u003e/\u003cname\u003e --json | jq -r '.running'`\n3. Check polecat directory: `ls \u003crig\u003e/polecats/\u003cname\u003e 2\u003e/dev/null`\n4. If BOTH session dead AND directory missing → orphan. Reset the bead:\n   ```bash\n   bd update \u003cbead-id\u003e --status=open --assignee=\n   gt mail send deacon/ -s \"ORPHAN_RECOVERED: \u003cbead-id\u003e\" \\\n     -m \"Bead \u003cbead-id\u003e was assigned to \u003crig\u003e/polecats/\u003cname\u003e which no longer exists.\n   The bead has been reset to open with no assignee.\n   Please re-dispatch to an available polecat.\"\n   ```\n5. If directory exists but session dead → skip (zombie detection handles it)\n6. If session alive → not an orphan, skip\n\n**Step 8: File likely GT bugs discovered during patrol**\n\nWhen findings look like platform/tooling defects (not ordinary stuck-worker situations), file a bug bead before or alongside escalation:\n\n```bash\nbd create --rig \u003crig\u003e --type bug --priority 1 \\\n  --title \"Witness patrol bug: \u003cshort symptom\u003e\" \\\n  --description \"Detected by \u003crig\u003e/witness during survey-workers.\nSymptoms: \u003cwhat failed\u003e\nContext: \u003cpolecat/issue IDs, command output\u003e\nReproduction: \u003cminimal steps\u003e\"\n```\n\nExamples: duplicate dispatch behavior, cleanup_status false alarms, branch-name handling regressions, unexpected destructive nuke behavior.","design":"","due_at":null,"ephemeral":0,"estimated_minutes":null,"event_kind":"","external_ref":null,"hook_bead":"","id":"gt-mol-j475b","is_template":0,"issue_type":"task","last_activity":null,"metadata":"{}","mol_type":"","notes":"","original_size":null,"owner":"","payload":"","pinned":0,"priority":2,"quality_score":null,"rig":"","role_bead":"","role_type":"","sender":"","source_repo":"","source_system":"","spec_id":"","status":"open","target":"","timeout_ns":0,"title":"Inspect all active polecats","updated_at":"2026-02-23T22:47:13Z","waiters":"","wisp_type":"","work_type":""}

A polecat with agent_state=running\nor hook_bead assigned but NO tmux session is a zombie that will sit forever\nundetected unless you proactively check.\n\nFor EVERY polecat with agent_state=running/working OR hook_bead assigned:\n```bash\ngt session status \u003crig\u003e/\u003cname\u003e --json | jq -r '.running' | grep -q true \u0026\u0026 echo ALIVE || echo ZOMBIE\n```\n\n**If ZOMBIE detected** (session missing, agent says working):\n\n1.

Check if it's safe to nuke:\n\n```bash\n# Check git status in the polecat's worktree\ncd polecats/\u003cname\u003e\ngit status --porcelain         # Should be empty (clean)\ngit log @{u}..HEAD      # Should have no unpushed commits\n```\n\n**If clean** (no uncommitted changes, no unpushed commits):\n```bash\n# Safe to nuke - no work to lose\ngt polecat nuke \u003cname\u003e\n```\nLog the auto-nuke for audit purposes. No escalation needed.\n\n**If dirty** (uncommitted or unpushed work):\n```bash\n# Escalate to Deacon - polecat has work that might be valuable\ngt mail send deacon/ -s \\\"IDLE_DIRTY: \u003cpolecat\u003e has uncommitted work\\\" \\\n  -m \\\"Polecat: \u003cname\u003e\nState: idle (no hook_bead)\nGit status: \u003cuncommitted-files\u003e\nUnpushed commits: \u003ccount\u003e\n\nPlease advise: recover work or discard?\\\"\n```\n\n**Rationale**: Idle polecats with clean git state are pure overhead. They have\nno work and no state worth preserving. Nuking them immediately frees resources\nand reduces noise. Only escalate when there's actual work at risk.\n\n**Step 4: Decide action**\n\n| Observation | Action |\n|-------------|--------|\n| agent_state=running, session alive, recent activity | None |\n| agent_state=running, session alive, idle 5-15 min | Gentle nudge |\n| agent_state=running, session alive, idle 15+ min | Direct nudge with deadline |\n| agent_state=running, SESSION DEAD | ZOMBIE — handle in Step 2a |\n| agent_state=stuck | Assess and help or escalate |\n| agent_state=done | Verify cleanup triggered (see Step 4a) |\n\n**Step 4a: Handle agent_state=done**\n\nIn the ephemeral model, polecats with agent_state=done and cleanup_status=clean\nshould already be nuked by HandlePolecatDone. Finding one here indicates:\n\n1. **Stale agent bead** - polecat was nuked but bead remains\n   ```bash\n   # Verify polecat doesn't exist anymore\n   ls polecats/\u003cname\u003e 2\u003e/dev/null || echo \"Already nuked\"\n   ```\n   If nuked, the agent bead is stale. Clean it up or ignore.\n\n2. **Cleanup wisp exists** - polecat has dirty state needing intervention\n   ```bash\n   bd list --label polecat:\u003cname\u003e --status=open\n   ```\n   Process in process-cleanups step.\n\n3. **No wisp, polecat exists** - POLECAT_DONE mail was missed\n   Try auto-nuke directly (ephemeral model):\n   ```bash\n   # Check cleanup_status and nuke if clean\n   gt polecat nuke \u003cname\u003e  # Will fail if dirty\n   ```\n   If nuke fails (dirty state), create cleanup wisp for investigation.\n\n**Step 5: Execute nudges**\n```bash\n# Use --mode=queue to avoid interrupting in-flight tool calls\ngt nudge --mode=queue \u003crig\u003e/polecats/\u003cname\u003e \"How's progress? Need help?\"\n```\n\n**Step 6: Escalate if needed**\n```bash\ngt mail send deacon/ -s \"Escalation: \u003cpolecat\u003e stuck\" \\\n  -m \"Polecat \u003cname\u003e reports stuck. Please intervene.\"\n```\n\n**Parallelism**: Use Task tool subagents to inspect multiple polecats concurrently.\n\n**ZFC Principle**: Trust agent_state from beads for WHAT agents report. But\nverify tmux session existence for WHETHER agents are alive. A dead session with\nagent_state=running is a zombie — the agent cannot correct its own state.\n\n**Step 7: ORPHANED BEAD DETECTION — Scan from beads side**\n\n🚨 **CRITICAL**: Zombie detection (Step 2a) scans FROM polecat directories.\nOnce a polecat is nuked and its directory removed, its beads become invisible\nto zombie detection. Orphaned bead detection scans FROM beads to catch this case.\n\n```bash\nbd list --status=in_progress --json --limit=0\nbd list --status=hooked --json --limit=0\n```\n\nFor each in_progress or hooked bead with a polecat assignee (format: `\u003crig\u003e/polecats/\u003cname\u003e`):\n1. Only check beads assigned to polecats in YOUR rig\n2. Check tmux session: `gt session status \u003crig\u003e/\u003cname\u003e --json | jq -r '.running'`\n3. Check polecat directory: `ls \u003crig\u003e/polecats/\u003cname\u003e 2\u003e/dev/null`\n4. If BOTH session dead AND directory missing → orphan. Reset the bead:\n   ```bash\n   bd update \u003cbead-id\u003e --status=open --assignee=\n   gt mail send deacon/ -s \"ORPHAN_RECOVERED: \u003cbead-id\u003e\" \\\n     -m \"Bead \u003cbead-id\u003e was assigned to \u003crig\u003e/polecats/\u003cname\u003e which no longer exists.\n   The bead has been reset to open with no assignee.\n   Please re-dispatch to an available polecat.\"\n   ```\n5. If directory exists but session dead → skip (zombie detection handles it)\n6.

A polecat with agent_state=running\nor hook_bead assigned but NO tmux session is a zombie that will sit forever\nundetected unless you proactively check.\n\nFor EVERY polecat with agent_state=running/working OR hook_bead assigned:\n```bash\ngt session status \u003crig\u003e/\u003cname\u003e --json | jq -r '.running' | grep -q true \u0026\u0026 echo ALIVE || echo ZOMBIE\n```\n\n**If ZOMBIE detected** (session missing, agent says working):\n\n1. Check git state to determine if work is recoverable:\n```bash\ncd polecats/\u003cname\u003e/\u003crig\u003e\ngit status --porcelain         # Uncommitted changes?\ngit log @{u}..HEAD      # Unpushed commits?\n```\n\n2. **If clean** (no uncommitted, no unpushed): Auto-nuke immediately.\n```bash\ngt polecat nuke \u003cname\u003e\n```\n\n3. **If dirty** (has unpushed/uncommitted work): Escalate to Deacon for recovery.\n```bash\ngt mail send deacon/ -s \"RECOVERY_NEEDED \u003crig\u003e/\u003cname\u003e\" \\\n  -m \"Polecat: \u003crig\u003e/\u003cname\u003e\nCleanup Status: \u003chas_uncommitted|has_unpushed|has_stash\u003e\nHook Bead: \u003chook_bead\u003e\nDetected: $(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)\n\nZombie detected: tmux session dead, agent_state=\u003cstate\u003e.\nThis polecat has unpushed/uncommitted work that will be lost if nuked.\nPlease coordinate recovery before authorizing cleanup.\"\n```\n\nAlso create a cleanup wisp for tracking:\n```bash\nbd create --ephemeral --title \"cleanup:\u003cname\u003e\" \\\n  --description \"Zombie detected: session dead, state=\u003cagent_state\u003e\" \\\n  --labels cleanup,polecat:\u003cname\u003e,state:zombie-detected\n```\n\n**Step 3: For running polecats (with LIVE session), assess progress**\n\nCheck the hook_bead field to see what they're working on:\n```bash\nbd show \u003chook_bead\u003e  # See current step/issue\n```\n\nYou can also verify they're responsive:\n```bash\ngt peek \u003crig\u003e/\u003cname\u003e 20\n```\n\nLook for:\n- Recent tool activity → making progress\n- Idle at prompt → may need nudge\n- Error messages → may need help\n\n**Step 3a: For idle polecats, auto-nuke if clean**\n\nWhen agent_state=idle, the polecat has no work assigned. Check if it's safe to nuke:\n\n```bash\n# Check git status in the polecat's worktree\ncd polecats/\u003cname\u003e\ngit status --porcelain         # Should be empty (clean)\ngit log @{u}..HEAD      # Should have no unpushed commits\n```\n\n**If clean** (no uncommitted changes, no unpushed commits):\n```bash\n# Safe to nuke - no work to lose\ngt polecat nuke \u003cname\u003e\n```\nLog the auto-nuke for audit purposes. No escalation needed.\n\n**If dirty** (uncommitted or unpushed work):\n```bash\n# Escalate to Deacon - polecat has work that might be valuable\ngt mail send deacon/ -s \\\"IDLE_DIRTY: \u003cpolecat\u003e has uncommitted work\\\" \\\n  -m \\\"Polecat: \u003cname\u003e\nState: idle (no hook_bead)\nGit status: \u003cuncommitted-files\u003e\nUnpushed commits: \u003ccount\u003e\n\nPlease advise: recover work or discard?\\\"\n```\n\n**Rationale**: Idle polecats with clean git state are pure overhead. They have\nno work and no state worth preserving. Nuking them immediately frees resources\nand reduces noise. Only escalate when there's actual work at risk.\n\n**Step 4: Decide action**\n\n| Observation | Action |\n|-------------|--------|\n| agent_state=running, session alive, recent activity | None |\n| agent_state=running, session alive, idle 5-15 min | Gentle nudge |\n| agent_state=running, session alive, idle 15+ min | Direct nudge with deadline |\n| agent_state=running, SESSION DEAD | ZOMBIE — handle in Step 2a |\n| agent_state=stuck | Assess and help or escalate |\n| agent_state=done | Verify cleanup triggered (see Step 4a) |\n\n**Step 4a: Handle agent_state=done**\n\nIn the ephemeral model, polecats with agent_state=done and cleanup_status=clean\nshould already be nuked by HandlePolecatDone. Finding one here indicates:\n\n1. **Stale agent bead** - polecat was nuked but bead remains\n   ```bash\n   # Verify polecat doesn't exist anymore\n   ls polecats/\u003cname\u003e 2\u003e/dev/null || echo \"Already nuked\"\n   ```\n   If nuked, the agent bead is stale. Clean it up or ignore.\n\n2. **Cleanup wisp exists** - polecat has dirty state needing intervention\n   ```bash\n   bd list --label polecat:\u003cname\u003e --status=open\n   ```\n   Process in process-cleanups step.\n\n3. **No wisp, polecat exists** - POLECAT_DONE mail was missed\n   Try auto-nuke directly (ephemeral model):\n   ```bash\n   # Check cleanup_status and nuke if clean\n   gt polecat nuke \u003cname\u003e  # Will fail if dirty\n   ```\n   If nuke fails (dirty state), create cleanup wisp for investigation.\n\n**Step 5: Execute nudges**\n```bash\n# Use --mode=queue to avoid interrupting in-flight tool calls\ngt nudge --mode=queue \u003crig\u003e/polecats/\u003cname\u003e \"How's progress? Need help?\"\n```\n\n**Step 6: Escalate if needed**\n```bash\ngt mail send deacon/ -s \"Escalation: \u003cpolecat\u003e stuck\" \\\n  -m \"Polecat \u003cname\u003e reports stuck. Please intervene.\"\n```\n\n**Parallelism**: Use Task tool subagents to inspect multiple polecats concurrently.\n\n**ZFC Principle**: Trust agent_state from beads for WHAT agents report. But\nverify tmux session existence for WHETHER agents are alive. A dead session with\nagent_state=running is a zombie — the agent cannot correct its own state.\n\n**Step 7: ORPHANED BEAD DETECTION — Scan from beads side**\n\n🚨 **CRITICAL**: Zombie detection (Step 2a) scans FROM polecat directories.\nOnce a polecat is nuked and its directory removed, its beads become invisible\nto zombie detection. Orphaned bead detection scans FROM beads to catch this case.\n\n```bash\nbd list --status=in_progress --json --limit=0\nbd list --status=hooked --json --limit=0\n```\n\nFor each in_progress or hooked bead with a polecat assignee (format: `\u003crig\u003e/polecats/\u003cname\u003e`):\n1. Only check beads assigned to polecats in YOUR rig\n2. Check tmux session: `gt session status \u003crig\u003e/\u003cname\u003e --json | jq -r '.running'`\n3. Check polecat directory: `ls \u003crig\u003e/polecats/\u003cname\u003e 2\u003e/dev/null`\n4. If BOTH session dead AND directory missing → orphan. Reset the bead:\n   ```bash\n   bd update \u003cbead-id\u003e --status=open --assignee=\n   gt mail send deacon/ -s \"ORPHAN_RECOVERED: \u003cbead-id\u003e\" \\\n     -m \"Bead \u003cbead-id\u003e was assigned to \u003crig\u003e/polecats/\u003cname\u003e which no longer exists.\n   The bead has been reset to open with no assignee.\n   Please re-dispatch to an available polecat.\"\n   ```\n5. If directory exists but session dead → skip (zombie detection handles it)\n6.

Check if it's safe to nuke:\n\n```bash\n# Check git status in the polecat's worktree\ncd polecats/\u003cname\u003e\ngit status --porcelain         # Should be empty (clean)\ngit log @{u}..HEAD      # Should have no unpushed commits\n```\n\n**If clean** (no uncommitted changes, no unpushed commits):\n```bash\n# Safe to nuke - no work to lose\ngt polecat nuke \u003cname\u003e\n```\nLog the auto-nuke for audit purposes. No escalation needed.\n\n**If dirty** (uncommitted or unpushed work):\n```bash\n# Escalate to Deacon - polecat has work that might be valuable\ngt mail send deacon/ -s \\\"IDLE_DIRTY: \u003cpolecat\u003e has uncommitted work\\\" \\\n  -m \\\"Polecat: \u003cname\u003e\nState: idle (no hook_bead)\nGit status: \u003cuncommitted-files\u003e\nUnpushed commits: \u003ccount\u003e\n\nPlease advise: recover work or discard?\\\"\n```\n\n**Rationale**: Idle polecats with clean git state are pure overhead. They have\nno work and no state worth preserving. Nuking them immediately frees resources\nand reduces noise.

Finding one here indicates:\n\n1. **Stale agent bead** - polecat was nuked but bead remains\n   ```bash\n   # Verify polecat doesn't exist anymore\n   ls polecats/\u003cname\u003e 2\u003e/dev/null || echo \"Already nuked\"\n   ```\n   If nuked, the agent bead is stale.

Check git state to determine if work is recoverable:\n```bash\ncd polecats/\u003cname\u003e/\u003crig\u003e\ngit status --porcelain         # Uncommitted changes?\ngit log @{u}..HEAD      # Unpushed commits?\n```\n\n2. **If clean** (no uncommitted, no unpushed): Auto-nuke immediately.\n```bash\ngt polecat nuke \u003cname\u003e\n```\n\n3. **If dirty** (has unpushed/uncommitted work): Escalate to Deacon for recovery.\n```bash\ngt mail send deacon/ -s \"RECOVERY_NEEDED \u003crig\u003e/\u003cname\u003e\" \\\n  -m \"Polecat: \u003crig\u003e/\u003cname\u003e\nCleanup Status: \u003chas_uncommitted|has_unpushed|has_stash\u003e\nHook Bead: \u003chook_bead\u003e\nDetected: $(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)\n\nZombie detected: tmux session dead, agent_state=\u003cstate\u003e.\nThis polecat has unpushed/uncommitted work that will be lost if nuked.\nPlease coordinate recovery before authorizing cleanup.\"\n```\n\nAlso create a cleanup wisp for tracking:\n```bash\nbd create --ephemeral --title \"cleanup:\u003cname\u003e\" \\\n  --description \"Zombie detected: session dead, state=\u003cagent_state\u003e\" \\\n  --labels cleanup,polecat:\u003cname\u003e,state:zombie-detected\n```\n\n**Step 3: For running polecats (with LIVE session), assess progress**\n\nCheck the hook_bead field to see what they're working on:\n```bash\nbd show \u003chook_bead\u003e  # See current step/issue\n```\n\nYou can also verify they're responsive:\n```bash\ngt peek \u003crig\u003e/\u003cname\u003e 20\n```\n\nLook for:\n- Recent tool activity → making progress\n- Idle at prompt → may need nudge\n- Error messages → may need help\n\n**Step 3a: For idle polecats, auto-nuke if clean**\n\nWhen agent_state=idle, the polecat has no work assigned. Check if it's safe to nuke:\n\n```bash\n# Check git status in the polecat's worktree\ncd polecats/\u003cname\u003e\ngit status --porcelain         # Should be empty (clean)\ngit log @{u}..HEAD      # Should have no unpushed commits\n```\n\n**If clean** (no uncommitted changes, no unpushed commits):\n```bash\n# Safe to nuke - no work to lose\ngt polecat nuke \u003cname\u003e\n```\nLog the auto-nuke for audit purposes. No escalation needed.\n\n**If dirty** (uncommitted or unpushed work):\n```bash\n# Escalate to Deacon - polecat has work that might be valuable\ngt mail send deacon/ -s \\\"IDLE_DIRTY: \u003cpolecat\u003e has uncommitted work\\\" \\\n  -m \\\"Polecat: \u003cname\u003e\nState: idle (no hook_bead)\nGit status: \u003cuncommitted-files\u003e\nUnpushed commits: \u003ccount\u003e\n\nPlease advise: recover work or discard?\\\"\n```\n\n**Rationale**: Idle polecats with clean git state are pure overhead. They have\nno work and no state worth preserving. Nuking them immediately frees resources\nand reduces noise. Only escalate when there's actual work at risk.\n\n**Step 4: Decide action**\n\n| Observation | Action |\n|-------------|--------|\n| agent_state=running, session alive, recent activity | None |\n| agent_state=running, session alive, idle 5-15 min | Gentle nudge |\n| agent_state=running, session alive, idle 15+ min | Direct nudge with deadline |\n| agent_state=running, SESSION DEAD | ZOMBIE — handle in Step 2a |\n| agent_state=stuck | Assess and help or escalate |\n| agent_state=done | Verify cleanup triggered (see Step 4a) |\n\n**Step 4a: Handle agent_state=done**\n\nIn the ephemeral model, polecats with agent_state=done and cleanup_status=clean\nshould already be nuked by HandlePolecatDone. Finding one here indicates:\n\n1. **Stale agent bead** - polecat was nuked but bead remains\n   ```bash\n   # Verify polecat doesn't exist anymore\n   ls polecats/\u003cname\u003e 2\u003e/dev/null || echo \"Already nuked\"\n   ```\n   If nuked, the agent bead is stale. Clean it up or ignore.\n\n2. **Cleanup wisp exists** - polecat has dirty state needing intervention\n   ```bash\n   bd list --label polecat:\u003cname\u003e --status=open\n   ```\n   Process in process-cleanups step.\n\n3. **No wisp, polecat exists** - POLECAT_DONE mail was missed\n   Try auto-nuke directly (ephemeral model):\n   ```bash\n   # Check cleanup_status and nuke if clean\n   gt polecat nuke \u003cname\u003e  # Will fail if dirty\n   ```\n   If nuke fails (dirty state), create cleanup wisp for investigation.\n\n**Step 5: Execute nudges**\n```bash\n# Use --mode=queue to avoid interrupting in-flight tool calls\ngt nudge --mode=queue \u003crig\u003e/polecats/\u003cname\u003e \"How's progress? Need help?\"\n```\n\n**Step 6: Escalate if needed**\n```bash\ngt mail send deacon/ -s \"Escalation: \u003cpolecat\u003e stuck\" \\\n  -m \"Polecat \u003cname\u003e reports stuck. Please intervene.\"\n```\n\n**Parallelism**: Use Task tool subagents to inspect multiple polecats concurrently.\n\n**ZFC Principle**: Trust agent_state from beads for WHAT agents report. But\nverify tmux session existence for WHETHER agents are alive. A dead session with\nagent_state=running is a zombie — the agent cannot correct its own state.\n\n**Step 7: ORPHANED BEAD DETECTION — Scan from beads side**\n\n🚨 **CRITICAL**: Zombie detection (Step 2a) scans FROM polecat directories.\nOnce a polecat is nuked and its directory removed, its beads become invisible\nto zombie detection. Orphaned bead detection scans FROM beads to catch this case.\n\n```bash\nbd list --status=in_progress --json --limit=0\nbd list --status=hooked --json --limit=0\n```\n\nFor each in_progress or hooked bead with a polecat assignee (format: `\u003crig\u003e/polecats/\u003cname\u003e`):\n1. Only check beads assigned to polecats in YOUR rig\n2. Check tmux session: `gt session status \u003crig\u003e/\u003cname\u003e --json | jq -r '.running'`\n3. Check polecat directory: `ls \u003crig\u003e/polecats/\u003cname\u003e 2\u003e/dev/null`\n4. If BOTH session dead AND directory missing → orphan. Reset the bead:\n   ```bash\n   bd update \u003cbead-id\u003e --status=open --assignee=\n   gt mail send deacon/ -s \"ORPHAN_RECOVERED: \u003cbead-id\u003e\" \\\n     -m \"Bead \u003cbead-id\u003e was assigned to \u003crig\u003e/polecats/\u003cname\u003e which no longer exists.\n   The bead has been reset to open with no assignee.\n   Please re-dispatch to an available polecat.\"\n   ```\n5. If directory exists but session dead → skip (zombie detection handles it)\n6. If session alive → not an orphan, skip","design":"","due_at":null,"ephemeral":0,"estimated_minutes":null,"event_kind":"","external_ref":null,"hook_bead":"","id":"gt-mol-lbo71","is_template":0,"issue_type":"task","last_activity":null,"metadata":"{}","mol_type":"","notes":"","original_size":null,"owner":"","payload":"","pinned":0,"priority":2,"quality_score":null,"rig":"","role_bead":"","role_type":"","sender":"","source_repo":"","source_system":"","spec_id":"","status":"closed","target":"","timeout_ns":0,"title":"Inspect all active polecats","updated_at":"2026-02-22T18:19:16Z","waiters":"","wisp_type":"","work_type":""}

Check if it's safe to nuke:\n\n```bash\n# Check git status in the polecat's worktree\ncd polecats/\u003cname\u003e\ngit status --porcelain         # Should be empty (clean)\ngit log @{u}..HEAD      # Should have no unpushed commits\n```\n\n**If clean** (no uncommitted changes, no unpushed commits):\n```bash\n# Safe to nuke - no work to lose\ngt polecat nuke \u003cname\u003e\n```\nLog the auto-nuke for audit purposes. No escalation needed.\n\n**If dirty** (uncommitted or unpushed work):\n```bash\n# Escalate to Deacon - polecat has work that might be valuable\ngt mail send deacon/ -s \\\"IDLE_DIRTY: \u003cpolecat\u003e has uncommitted work\\\" \\\n  -m \\\"Polecat: \u003cname\u003e\nState: idle (no hook_bead)\nGit status: \u003cuncommitted-files\u003e\nUnpushed commits: \u003ccount\u003e\n\nPlease advise: recover work or discard?\\\"\n```\n\n**Rationale**: Idle polecats with clean git state are pure overhead. They have\nno work and no state worth preserving. Nuking them immediately frees resources\nand reduces noise. Only escalate when there's actual work at risk.\n\n**Step 4: Decide action**\n\n| Observation | Action |\n|-------------|--------|\n| agent_state=running, session alive, recent activity | None |\n| agent_state=running, session alive, idle 5-15 min | Gentle nudge |\n| agent_state=running, session alive, idle 15+ min | Direct nudge with deadline |\n| agent_state=running, SESSION DEAD | ZOMBIE — handle in Step 2a |\n| agent_state=stuck | Assess and help or escalate |\n| agent_state=done | Verify cleanup triggered (see Step 4a) |\n\n**Step 4a: Handle agent_state=done**\n\nIn the ephemeral model, polecats with agent_state=done and cleanup_status=clean\nshould already be nuked by HandlePolecatDone. Finding one here indicates:\n\n1. **Stale agent bead** - polecat was nuked but bead remains\n   ```bash\n   # Verify polecat doesn't exist anymore\n   ls polecats/\u003cname\u003e 2\u003e/dev/null || echo \"Already nuked\"\n   ```\n   If nuked, the agent bead is stale. Clean it up or ignore.\n\n2. **Cleanup wisp exists** - polecat has dirty state needing intervention\n   ```bash\n   bd list --label polecat:\u003cname\u003e --status=open\n   ```\n   Process in process-cleanups step.\n\n3. **No wisp, polecat exists** - POLECAT_DONE mail was missed\n   Try auto-nuke directly (ephemeral model):\n   ```bash\n   # Check cleanup_status and nuke if clean\n   gt polecat nuke \u003cname\u003e  # Will fail if dirty\n   ```\n   If nuke fails (dirty state), create cleanup wisp for investigation.\n\n**Step 5: Execute nudges**\n```bash\n# Use --mode=queue to avoid interrupting in-flight tool calls\ngt nudge --mode=queue \u003crig\u003e/polecats/\u003cname\u003e \"How's progress? Need help?\"\n```\n\n**Step 6: Escalate if needed**\n```bash\ngt mail send deacon/ -s \"Escalation: \u003cpolecat\u003e stuck\" \\\n  -m \"Polecat \u003cname\u003e reports stuck. Please intervene.\"\n```\n\n**Parallelism**: Use Task tool subagents to inspect multiple polecats concurrently.\n\n**ZFC Principle**: Trust agent_state from beads for WHAT agents report. But\nverify tmux session existence for WHETHER agents are alive. A dead session with\nagent_state=running is a zombie — the agent cannot correct its own state.\n\n**Step 7: ORPHANED BEAD DETECTION — Scan from beads side**\n\n🚨 **CRITICAL**: Zombie detection (Step 2a) scans FROM polecat directories.\nOnce a polecat is nuked and its directory removed, its beads become invisible\nto zombie detection. Orphaned bead detection scans FROM beads to catch this case.\n\n```bash\nbd list --status=in_progress --json --limit=0\nbd list --status=hooked --json --limit=0\n```\n\nFor each in_progress or hooked bead with a polecat assignee (format: `\u003crig\u003e/polecats/\u003cname\u003e`):\n1.

Only escalate when there's actual work at risk.\n\n**Step 4: Decide action**\n\n| Observation | Action |\n|-------------|--------|\n| agent_state=running, session alive, recent activity | None |\n| agent_state=running, session alive, idle 5-15 min | Gentle nudge |\n| agent_state=running, session alive, idle 15+ min | Direct nudge with deadline |\n| agent_state=running, SESSION DEAD | ZOMBIE — handle in Step 2a |\n| agent_state=stuck | Assess and help or escalate |\n| agent_state=done | Verify cleanup triggered (see Step 4a) |\n\n**Step 4a: Handle agent_state=done**\n\nIn the ephemeral model, polecats with agent_state=done and cleanup_status=clean\nshould already be nuked by HandlePolecatDone. Finding one here indicates:\n\n1. **Stale agent bead** - polecat was nuked but bead remains\n   ```bash\n   # Verify polecat doesn't exist anymore\n   ls polecats/\u003cname\u003e 2\u003e/dev/null || echo \"Already nuked\"\n   ```\n   If nuked, the agent bead is stale. Clean it up or ignore.\n\n2. **Cleanup wisp exists** - polecat has dirty state needing intervention\n   ```bash\n   bd list --label polecat:\u003cname\u003e --status=open\n   ```\n   Process in process-cleanups step.\n\n3. **No wisp, polecat exists** - POLECAT_DONE mail was missed\n   Try auto-nuke directly (ephemeral model):\n   ```bash\n   # Check cleanup_status and nuke if clean\n   gt polecat nuke \u003cname\u003e  # Will fail if dirty\n   ```\n   If nuke fails (dirty state), create cleanup wisp for investigation.\n\n**Step 5: Execute nudges**\n```bash\n# Use --mode=queue to avoid interrupting in-flight tool calls\ngt nudge --mode=queue \u003crig\u003e/polecats/\u003cname\u003e \"How's progress? Need help?\"\n```\n\n**Step 6: Escalate if needed**\n```bash\ngt mail send deacon/ -s \"Escalation: \u003cpolecat\u003e stuck\" \\\n  -m \"Polecat \u003cname\u003e reports stuck. Please intervene.\"\n```\n\n**Parallelism**: Use Task tool subagents to inspect multiple polecats concurrently.\n\n**ZFC Principle**: Trust agent_state from beads for WHAT agents report. But\nverify tmux session existence for WHETHER agents are alive. A dead session with\nagent_state=running is a zombie — the agent cannot correct its own state.\n\n**Step 7: ORPHANED BEAD DETECTION — Scan from beads side**\n\n🚨 **CRITICAL**: Zombie detection (Step 2a) scans FROM polecat directories.\nOnce a polecat is nuked and its directory removed, its beads become invisible\nto zombie detection. Orphaned bead detection scans FROM beads to catch this case.\n\n```bash\nbd list --status=in_progress --json --limit=0\nbd list --status=hooked --json --limit=0\n```\n\nFor each in_progress or hooked bead with a polecat assignee (format: `\u003crig\u003e/polecats/\u003cname\u003e`):\n1. Only check beads assigned to polecats in YOUR rig\n2. Check tmux session: `gt session status \u003crig\u003e/\u003cname\u003e --json | jq -r '.running'`\n3. Check polecat directory: `ls \u003crig\u003e/polecats/\u003cname\u003e 2\u003e/dev/null`\n4. If BOTH session dead AND directory missing → orphan. Reset the bead:\n   ```bash\n   bd update \u003cbead-id\u003e --status=open --assignee=\n   gt mail send deacon/ -s \"ORPHAN_RECOVERED: \u003cbead-id\u003e\" \\\n     -m \"Bead \u003cbead-id\u003e was assigned to \u003crig\u003e/polecats/\u003cname\u003e which no longer exists.\n   The bead has been reset to open with no assignee.\n   Please re-dispatch to an available polecat.\"\n   ```\n5. If directory exists but session dead → skip (zombie detection handles it)\n6. If session alive → not an orphan, skip","design":"","due_at":null,"ephemeral":0,"estimated_minutes":null,"event_kind":"","external_ref":null,"hook_bead":"","id":"gt-mol-o0ki","is_template":0,"issue_type":"task","last_activity":null,"metadata":"{}","mol_type":"","notes":"","original_size":null,"owner":"","payload":"","pinned":0,"priority":2,"quality_score":null,"rig":"","role_bead":"","role_type":"","sender":"","source_repo":"","source_system":"","spec_id":"","status":"closed","target":"","timeout_ns":0,"title":"Inspect all active polecats","updated_at":"2026-02-22T05:49:34Z","waiters":"","wisp_type":"","work_type":""}

Check git state to determine if work is recoverable:\n```bash\ncd polecats/\u003cname\u003e/\u003crig\u003e\ngit status --porcelain         # Uncommitted changes?\ngit log @{u}..HEAD      # Unpushed commits?\n```\n\n2. **If clean** (no uncommitted, no unpushed): Auto-nuke immediately.\n```bash\ngt polecat nuke \u003cname\u003e\n```\n\n3. **If dirty** (has unpushed/uncommitted work): Escalate to Deacon for recovery.\n```bash\ngt mail send deacon/ -s \"RECOVERY_NEEDED \u003crig\u003e/\u003cname\u003e\" \\\n  -m \"Polecat: \u003crig\u003e/\u003cname\u003e\nCleanup Status: \u003chas_uncommitted|has_unpushed|has_stash\u003e\nHook Bead: \u003chook_bead\u003e\nDetected: $(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)\n\nZombie detected: tmux session dead, agent_state=\u003cstate\u003e.\nThis polecat has unpushed/uncommitted work that will be lost if nuked.\nPlease coordinate recovery before authorizing cleanup.\"\n```\n\nAlso create a cleanup wisp for tracking:\n```bash\nbd create --ephemeral --title \"cleanup:\u003cname\u003e\" \\\n  --description \"Zombie detected: session dead, state=\u003cagent_state\u003e\" \\\n  --labels cleanup,polecat:\u003cname\u003e,state:zombie-detected\n```\n\n**Step 3: For running polecats (with LIVE session), assess progress**\n\nCheck the hook_bead field to see what they're working on:\n```bash\nbd show \u003chook_bead\u003e  # See current step/issue\n```\n\nYou can also verify they're responsive:\n```bash\ngt peek \u003crig\u003e/\u003cname\u003e 20\n```\n\nLook for:\n- Recent tool activity → making progress\n- Idle at prompt → may need nudge\n- Error messages → may need help\n\n**Step 3a: For idle polecats, auto-nuke if clean**\n\nWhen agent_state=idle, the polecat has no work assigned. Check if it's safe to nuke:\n\n```bash\n# Check git status in the polecat's worktree\ncd polecats/\u003cname\u003e\ngit status --porcelain         # Should be empty (clean)\ngit log @{u}..HEAD      # Should have no unpushed commits\n```\n\n**If clean** (no uncommitted changes, no unpushed commits):\n```bash\n# Safe to nuke - no work to lose\ngt polecat nuke \u003cname\u003e\n```\nLog the auto-nuke for audit purposes. No escalation needed.\n\n**If dirty** (uncommitted or unpushed work):\n```bash\n# Escalate to Deacon - polecat has work that might be valuable\ngt mail send deacon/ -s \\\"IDLE_DIRTY: \u003cpolecat\u003e has uncommitted work\\\" \\\n  -m \\\"Polecat: \u003cname\u003e\nState: idle (no hook_bead)\nGit status: \u003cuncommitted-files\u003e\nUnpushed commits: \u003ccount\u003e\n\nPlease advise: recover work or discard?\\\"\n```\n\n**Rationale**: Idle polecats with clean git state are pure overhead. They have\nno work and no state worth preserving. Nuking them immediately frees resources\nand reduces noise. Only escalate when there's actual work at risk.\n\n**Step 4: Decide action**\n\n| Observation | Action |\n|-------------|--------|\n| agent_state=running, session alive, recent activity | None |\n| agent_state=running, session alive, idle 5-15 min | Gentle nudge |\n| agent_state=running, session alive, idle 15+ min | Direct nudge with deadline |\n| agent_state=running, SESSION DEAD | ZOMBIE — handle in Step 2a |\n| agent_state=stuck | Assess and help or escalate |\n| agent_state=done | Verify cleanup triggered (see Step 4a) |\n\n**Step 4a: Handle agent_state=done**\n\nIn the ephemeral model, polecats with agent_state=done and cleanup_status=clean\nshould already be nuked by HandlePolecatDone. Finding one here indicates:\n\n1. **Stale agent bead** - polecat was nuked but bead remains\n   ```bash\n   # Verify polecat doesn't exist anymore\n   ls polecats/\u003cname\u003e 2\u003e/dev/null || echo \"Already nuked\"\n   ```\n   If nuked, the agent bead is stale. Clean it up or ignore.\n\n2. **Cleanup wisp exists** - polecat has dirty state needing intervention\n   ```bash\n   bd list --label polecat:\u003cname\u003e --status=open\n   ```\n   Process in process-cleanups step.\n\n3. **No wisp, polecat exists** - POLECAT_DONE mail was missed\n   Try auto-nuke directly (ephemeral model):\n   ```bash\n   # Check cleanup_status and nuke if clean\n   gt polecat nuke \u003cname\u003e  # Will fail if dirty\n   ```\n   If nuke fails (dirty state), create cleanup wisp for investigation.\n\n**Step 5: Execute nudges**\n```bash\n# Use --mode=queue to avoid interrupting in-flight tool calls\ngt nudge --mode=queue \u003crig\u003e/polecats/\u003cname\u003e \"How's progress? Need help?\"\n```\n\n**Step 6: Escalate if needed**\n```bash\ngt mail send deacon/ -s \"Escalation: \u003cpolecat\u003e stuck\" \\\n  -m \"Polecat \u003cname\u003e reports stuck. Please intervene.\"\n```\n\n**Parallelism**: Use Task tool subagents to inspect multiple polecats concurrently.\n\n**ZFC Principle**: Trust agent_state from beads for WHAT agents report. But\nverify tmux session existence for WHETHER agents are alive. A dead session with\nagent_state=running is a zombie — the agent cannot correct its own state.\n\n**Step 7: ORPHANED BEAD DETECTION — Scan from beads side**\n\n🚨 **CRITICAL**: Zombie detection (Step 2a) scans FROM polecat directories.\nOnce a polecat is nuked and its directory removed, its beads become invisible\nto zombie detection. Orphaned bead detection scans FROM beads to catch this case.\n\n```bash\nbd list --status=in_progress --json --limit=0\nbd list --status=hooked --json --limit=0\n```\n\nFor each in_progress or hooked bead with a polecat assignee (format: `\u003crig\u003e/polecats/\u003cname\u003e`):\n1. Only check beads assigned to polecats in YOUR rig\n2. Check tmux session: `gt session status \u003crig\u003e/\u003cname\u003e --json | jq -r '.running'`\n3. Check polecat directory: `ls \u003crig\u003e/polecats/\u003cname\u003e 2\u003e/dev/null`\n4. If BOTH session dead AND directory missing → orphan. Reset the bead:\n   ```bash\n   bd update \u003cbead-id\u003e --status=open --assignee=\n   gt mail send deacon/ -s \"ORPHAN_RECOVERED: \u003cbead-id\u003e\" \\\n     -m \"Bead \u003cbead-id\u003e was assigned to \u003crig\u003e/polecats/\u003cname\u003e which no longer exists.\n   The bead has been reset to open with no assignee.\n   Please re-dispatch to an available polecat.\"\n   ```\n5. If directory exists but session dead → skip (zombie detection handles it)\n6. If session alive → not an orphan, skip","design":"","due_at":null,"ephemeral":0,"estimated_minutes":null,"event_kind":"","external_ref":null,"hook_bead":"","id":"gt-mol-omii8","is_template":0,"issue_type":"task","last_activity":null,"metadata":"{}","mol_type":"","notes":"","original_size":null,"owner":"","payload":"","pinned":0,"priority":2,"quality_score":null,"rig":"","role_bead":"","role_type":"","sender":"","source_repo":"","source_system":"","spec_id":"","status":"closed","target":"","timeout_ns":0,"title":"Inspect all active polecats","updated_at":"2026-02-22T10:40:42Z","waiters":"","wisp_type":"","work_type":""}

The source branch may have been deleted while the MR bead is still open.\n  These likely need to be closed or investigated.\n\n- **Queue depth**: A large number of unclaimed MRs may indicate the refinery is down\n  or overwhelmed.

Check if it's safe to nuke:\n\n```bash\n# Check git status in the polecat's worktree\ncd polecats/\u003cname\u003e\ngit status --porcelain         # Should be empty (clean)\ngit log @{u}..HEAD      # Should have no unpushed commits\n```\n\n**If clean** (no uncommitted changes, no unpushed commits):\n```bash\n# Safe to nuke - no work to lose\ngt polecat nuke \u003cname\u003e\n```\nLog the auto-nuke for audit purposes. No escalation needed.\n\n**If dirty** (uncommitted or unpushed work):\n```bash\n# Escalate to Deacon - polecat has work that might be valuable\ngt mail send deacon/ -s \\\"IDLE_DIRTY: \u003cpolecat\u003e has uncommitted work\\\" \\\n  -m \\\"Polecat: \u003cname\u003e\nState: idle (no hook_bead)\nGit status: \u003cuncommitted-files\u003e\nUnpushed commits: \u003ccount\u003e\n\nPlease advise: recover work or discard?\\\"\n```\n\n**Rationale**: Idle polecats with clean git state are pure overhead. They have\nno work and no state worth preserving. Nuking them immediately frees resources\nand reduces noise. Only escalate when there's actual work at risk.\n\n**Step 4: Decide action**\n\n| Observation | Action |\n|-------------|--------|\n| agent_state=running, session alive, recent activity | None |\n| agent_state=running, session alive, idle 5-15 min | Gentle nudge |\n| agent_state=running, session alive, idle 15+ min | Direct nudge with deadline |\n| agent_state=running, SESSION DEAD | ZOMBIE — handle in Step 2a |\n| agent_state=stuck | Assess and help or escalate |\n| agent_state=done | Verify cleanup triggered (see Step 4a) |\n\n**Step 4a: Handle agent_state=done**\n\nIn the ephemeral model, polecats with agent_state=done and cleanup_status=clean\nshould already be nuked by HandlePolecatDone. Finding one here indicates:\n\n1. **Stale agent bead** - polecat was nuked but bead remains\n   ```bash\n   # Verify polecat doesn't exist anymore\n   ls polecats/\u003cname\u003e 2\u003e/dev/null || echo \"Already nuked\"\n   ```\n   If nuked, the agent bead is stale. Clean it up or ignore.\n\n2. **Cleanup wisp exists** - polecat has dirty state needing intervention\n   ```bash\n   bd list --label polecat:\u003cname\u003e --status=open\n   ```\n   Process in process-cleanups step.\n\n3. **No wisp, polecat exists** - POLECAT_DONE mail was missed\n   Try auto-nuke directly (ephemeral model):\n   ```bash\n   # Check cleanup_status and nuke if clean\n   gt polecat nuke \u003cname\u003e  # Will fail if dirty\n   ```\n   If nuke fails (dirty state), create cleanup wisp for investigation.\n\n**Step 5: Execute nudges**\n```bash\n# Use --mode=queue to avoid interrupting in-flight tool calls\ngt nudge --mode=queue \u003crig\u003e/polecats/\u003cname\u003e \"How's progress? Need help?\"\n```\n\n**Step 6: Escalate if needed**\n```bash\ngt mail send deacon/ -s \"Escalation: \u003cpolecat\u003e stuck\" \\\n  -m \"Polecat \u003cname\u003e reports stuck. Please intervene.\"\n```\n\n**Parallelism**: Use Task tool subagents to inspect multiple polecats concurrently.\n\n**ZFC Principle**: Trust agent_state from beads for WHAT agents report. But\nverify tmux session existence for WHETHER agents are alive. A dead session with\nagent_state=running is a zombie — the agent cannot correct its own state.\n\n**Step 7: ORPHANED BEAD DETECTION — Scan from beads side**\n\n🚨 **CRITICAL**: Zombie detection (Step 2a) scans FROM polecat directories.\nOnce a polecat is nuked and its directory removed, its beads become invisible\nto zombie detection. Orphaned bead detection scans FROM beads to catch this case.\n\n```bash\nbd list --status=in_progress --json --limit=0\nbd list --status=hooked --json --limit=0\n```\n\nFor each in_progress or hooked bead with a polecat assignee (format: `\u003crig\u003e/polecats/\u003cname\u003e`):\n1. Only check beads assigned to polecats in YOUR rig\n2. Check tmux session: `gt session status \u003crig\u003e/\u003cname\u003e --json | jq -r '.running'`\n3. Check polecat directory: `ls \u003crig\u003e/polecats/\u003cname\u003e 2\u003e/dev/null`\n4. If BOTH session dead AND directory missing → orphan. Reset the bead:\n   ```bash\n   bd update \u003cbead-id\u003e --status=open --assignee=\n   gt mail send deacon/ -s \"ORPHAN_RECOVERED: \u003cbead-id\u003e\" \\\n     -m \"Bead \u003cbead-id\u003e was assigned to \u003crig\u003e/polecats/\u003cname\u003e which no longer exists.\n   The bead has been reset to open with no assignee.\n   Please re-dispatch to an available polecat.\"\n   ```\n5.

A polecat with agent_state=running\nor hook_bead assigned but NO tmux session is a zombie that will sit forever\nundetected unless you proactively check.\n\nFor EVERY polecat with agent_state=running/working OR hook_bead assigned:\n```bash\ngt session status \u003crig\u003e/\u003cname\u003e --json | jq -r '.running' | grep -q true \u0026\u0026 echo ALIVE || echo ZOMBIE\n```\n\n**If ZOMBIE detected** (session missing, agent says working):\n\n1.

Check if it's safe to nuke:\n\n```bash\n# Check git status in the polecat's worktree\ncd polecats/\u003cname\u003e\ngit status --porcelain         # Should be empty (clean)\ngit log @{u}..HEAD      # Should have no unpushed commits\n```\n\n**If clean** (no uncommitted changes, no unpushed commits):\n```bash\n# Safe to nuke - no work to lose\ngt polecat nuke \u003cname\u003e\n```\nLog the auto-nuke for audit purposes. No escalation needed.\n\n**If dirty** (uncommitted or unpushed work):\n```bash\n# Escalate to Deacon - polecat has work that might be valuable\ngt mail send deacon/ -s \\\"IDLE_DIRTY: \u003cpolecat\u003e has uncommitted work\\\" \\\n  -m \\\"Polecat: \u003cname\u003e\nState: idle (no hook_bead)\nGit status: \u003cuncommitted-files\u003e\nUnpushed commits: \u003ccount\u003e\n\nPlease advise: recover work or discard?\\\"\n```\n\n**Rationale**: Idle polecats with clean git state are pure overhead. They have\nno work and no state worth preserving. Nuking them immediately frees resources\nand reduces noise. Only escalate when there's actual work at risk.\n\n**Step 4: Decide action**\n\n| Observation | Action |\n|-------------|--------|\n| agent_state=running, session alive, recent activity | None |\n| agent_state=running, session alive, idle 5-15 min | Gentle nudge |\n| agent_state=running, session alive, idle 15+ min | Direct nudge with deadline |\n| agent_state=running, SESSION DEAD | ZOMBIE — handle in Step 2a |\n| agent_state=stuck | Assess and help or escalate |\n| agent_state=done | Verify cleanup triggered (see Step 4a) |\n\n**Step 4a: Handle agent_state=done**\n\nIn the ephemeral model, polecats with agent_state=done and cleanup_status=clean\nshould already be nuked by HandlePolecatDone. Finding one here indicates:\n\n1. **Stale agent bead** - polecat was nuked but bead remains\n   ```bash\n   # Verify polecat doesn't exist anymore\n   ls polecats/\u003cname\u003e 2\u003e/dev/null || echo \"Already nuked\"\n   ```\n   If nuked, the agent bead is stale. Clean it up or ignore.\n\n2. **Cleanup wisp exists** - polecat has dirty state needing intervention\n   ```bash\n   bd list --label polecat:\u003cname\u003e --status=open\n   ```\n   Process in process-cleanups step.\n\n3. **No wisp, polecat exists** - POLECAT_DONE mail was missed\n   Try auto-nuke directly (ephemeral model):\n   ```bash\n   # Check cleanup_status and nuke if clean\n   gt polecat nuke \u003cname\u003e  # Will fail if dirty\n   ```\n   If nuke fails (dirty state), create cleanup wisp for investigation.\n\n**Step 5: Execute nudges**\n```bash\n# Use --mode=queue to avoid interrupting in-flight tool calls\ngt nudge --mode=queue \u003crig\u003e/polecats/\u003cname\u003e \"How's progress? Need help?\"\n```\n\n**Step 6: Escalate if needed**\n```bash\ngt mail send deacon/ -s \"Escalation: \u003cpolecat\u003e stuck\" \\\n  -m \"Polecat \u003cname\u003e reports stuck. Please intervene.\"\n```\n\n**Parallelism**: Use Task tool subagents to inspect multiple polecats concurrently.\n\n**ZFC Principle**: Trust agent_state from beads for WHAT agents report. But\nverify tmux session existence for WHETHER agents are alive. A dead session with\nagent_state=running is a zombie — the agent cannot correct its own state.\n\n**Step 7: ORPHANED BEAD DETECTION — Scan from beads side**\n\n🚨 **CRITICAL**: Zombie detection (Step 2a) scans FROM polecat directories.\nOnce a polecat is nuked and its directory removed, its beads become invisible\nto zombie detection. Orphaned bead detection scans FROM beads to catch this case.\n\n```bash\nbd list --status=in_progress --json --limit=0\nbd list --status=hooked --json --limit=0\n```\n\nFor each in_progress or hooked bead with a polecat assignee (format: `\u003crig\u003e/polecats/\u003cname\u003e`):\n1. Only check beads assigned to polecats in YOUR rig\n2. Check tmux session: `gt session status \u003crig\u003e/\u003cname\u003e --json | jq -r '.running'`\n3. Check polecat directory: `ls \u003crig\u003e/polecats/\u003cname\u003e 2\u003e/dev/null`\n4. If BOTH session dead AND directory missing → orphan. Reset the bead:\n   ```bash\n   bd update \u003cbead-id\u003e --status=open --assignee=\n   gt mail send deacon/ -s \"ORPHAN_RECOVERED: \u003cbead-id\u003e\" \\\n     -m \"Bead \u003cbead-id\u003e was assigned to \u003crig\u003e/polecats/\u003cname\u003e which no longer exists.\n   The bead has been reset to open with no assignee.\n   Please re-dispatch to an available polecat.\"\n   ```\n5. If directory exists but session dead → skip (zombie detection handles it)\n6. If session alive → not an orphan, skip\n\n**Step 8: File likely GT bugs discovered during patrol**\n\nWhen findings look like platform/tooling defects (not ordinary stuck-worker situations), file a bug bead before or alongside escalation:\n\n```bash\nbd create --rig \u003crig\u003e --type bug --priority 1 \\\n  --title \"Witness patrol bug: \u003cshort symptom\u003e\" \\\n  --description \"Detected by \u003crig\u003e/witness during survey-workers.\nSymptoms: \u003cwhat failed\u003e\nContext: \u003cpolecat/issue IDs, command output\u003e\nReproduction: \u003cminimal steps\u003e\"\n```\n\nExamples: duplicate dispatch behavior, cleanup_status false alarms, branch-name handling regressions, unexpected destructive nuke behavior.","design":"","due_at":null,"ephemeral":0,"estimated_minutes":null,"event_kind":"","external_ref":null,"hook_bead":"","id":"gt-mol-quvzi","is_template":0,"issue_type":"task","last_activity":null,"metadata":"{}","mol_type":"","notes":"","original_size":null,"owner":"","payload":"","pinned":0,"priority":2,"quality_score":null,"rig":"","role_bead":"","role_type":"","sender":"","source_repo":"","source_system":"","spec_id":"","status":"closed","target":"","timeout_ns":0,"title":"Inspect all active polecats","updated_at":"2026-02-23T23:06:54Z","waiters":"","wisp_type":"","work_type":""}

Check if it's safe to nuke:\n\n```bash\n# Check git status in the polecat's worktree\ncd polecats/\u003cname\u003e\ngit status --porcelain         # Should be empty (clean)\ngit log @{u}..HEAD      # Should have no unpushed commits\n```\n\n**If clean** (no uncommitted changes, no unpushed commits):\n```bash\n# Safe to nuke - no work to lose\ngt polecat nuke \u003cname\u003e\n```\nLog the auto-nuke for audit purposes. No escalation needed.\n\n**If dirty** (uncommitted or unpushed work):\n```bash\n# Escalate to Deacon - polecat has work that might be valuable\ngt mail send deacon/ -s \\\"IDLE_DIRTY: \u003cpolecat\u003e has uncommitted work\\\" \\\n  -m \\\"Polecat: \u003cname\u003e\nState: idle (no hook_bead)\nGit status: \u003cuncommitted-files\u003e\nUnpushed commits: \u003ccount\u003e\n\nPlease advise: recover work or discard?\\\"\n```\n\n**Rationale**: Idle polecats with clean git state are pure overhead. They have\nno work and no state worth preserving. Nuking them immediately frees resources\nand reduces noise. Only escalate when there's actual work at risk.\n\n**Step 4: Decide action**\n\n| Observation | Action |\n|-------------|--------|\n| agent_state=running, session alive, recent activity | None |\n| agent_state=running, session alive, idle 5-15 min | Gentle nudge |\n| agent_state=running, session alive, idle 15+ min | Direct nudge with deadline |\n| agent_state=running, SESSION DEAD | ZOMBIE — handle in Step 2a |\n| agent_state=stuck | Assess and help or escalate |\n| agent_state=done | Verify cleanup triggered (see Step 4a) |\n\n**Step 4a: Handle agent_state=done**\n\nIn the ephemeral model, polecats with agent_state=done and cleanup_status=clean\nshould already be nuked by HandlePolecatDone. Finding one here indicates:\n\n1. **Stale agent bead** - polecat was nuked but bead remains\n   ```bash\n   # Verify polecat doesn't exist anymore\n   ls polecats/\u003cname\u003e 2\u003e/dev/null || echo \"Already nuked\"\n   ```\n   If nuked, the agent bead is stale. Clean it up or ignore.\n\n2. **Cleanup wisp exists** - polecat has dirty state needing intervention\n   ```bash\n   bd list --label polecat:\u003cname\u003e --status=open\n   ```\n   Process in process-cleanups step.\n\n3. **No wisp, polecat exists** - POLECAT_DONE mail was missed\n   Try auto-nuke directly (ephemeral model):\n   ```bash\n   # Check cleanup_status and nuke if clean\n   gt polecat nuke \u003cname\u003e  # Will fail if dirty\n   ```\n   If nuke fails (dirty state), create cleanup wisp for investigation.\n\n**Step 5: Execute nudges**\n```bash\n# Use --mode=queue to avoid interrupting in-flight tool calls\ngt nudge --mode=queue \u003crig\u003e/polecats/\u003cname\u003e \"How's progress? Need help?\"\n```\n\n**Step 6: Escalate if needed**\n```bash\ngt mail send deacon/ -s \"Escalation: \u003cpolecat\u003e stuck\" \\\n  -m \"Polecat \u003cname\u003e reports stuck. Please intervene.\"\n```\n\n**Parallelism**: Use Task tool subagents to inspect multiple polecats concurrently.\n\n**ZFC Principle**: Trust agent_state from beads for WHAT agents report. But\nverify tmux session existence for WHETHER agents are alive. A dead session with\nagent_state=running is a zombie — the agent cannot correct its own state.\n\n**Step 7: ORPHANED BEAD DETECTION — Scan from beads side**\n\n🚨 **CRITICAL**: Zombie detection (Step 2a) scans FROM polecat directories.\nOnce a polecat is nuked and its directory removed, its beads become invisible\nto zombie detection. Orphaned bead detection scans FROM beads to catch this case.\n\n```bash\nbd list --status=in_progress --json --limit=0\nbd list --status=hooked --json --limit=0\n```\n\nFor each in_progress or hooked bead with a polecat assignee (format: `\u003crig\u003e/polecats/\u003cname\u003e`):\n1. Only check beads assigned to polecats in YOUR rig\n2. Check tmux session: `gt session status \u003crig\u003e/\u003cname\u003e --json | jq -r '.running'`\n3. Check polecat directory: `ls \u003crig\u003e/polecats/\u003cname\u003e 2\u003e/dev/null`\n4. If BOTH session dead AND directory missing → orphan. Reset the bead:\n   ```bash\n   bd update \u003cbead-id\u003e --status=open --assignee=\n   gt mail send deacon/ -s \"ORPHAN_RECOVERED: \u003cbead-id\u003e\" \\\n     -m \"Bead \u003cbead-id\u003e was assigned to \u003crig\u003e/polecats/\u003cname\u003e which no longer exists.\n   The bead has been reset to open with no assignee.\n   Please re-dispatch to an available polecat.\"\n   ```\n5.

Check git state to determine if work is recoverable:\n```bash\ncd polecats/\u003cname\u003e/\u003crig\u003e\ngit status --porcelain         # Uncommitted changes?\ngit log @{u}..HEAD      # Unpushed commits?\n```\n\n2. **If clean** (no uncommitted, no unpushed): Auto-nuke immediately.\n```bash\ngt polecat nuke \u003cname\u003e\n```\n\n3. **If dirty** (has unpushed/uncommitted work): Escalate to Deacon for recovery.\n```bash\ngt mail send deacon/ -s \"RECOVERY_NEEDED \u003crig\u003e/\u003cname\u003e\" \\\n  -m \"Polecat: \u003crig\u003e/\u003cname\u003e\nCleanup Status: \u003chas_uncommitted|has_unpushed|has_stash\u003e\nHook Bead: \u003chook_bead\u003e\nDetected: $(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)\n\nZombie detected: tmux session dead, agent_state=\u003cstate\u003e.\nThis polecat has unpushed/uncommitted work that will be lost if nuked.\nPlease coordinate recovery before authorizing cleanup.\"\n```\n\nAlso create a cleanup wisp for tracking:\n```bash\nbd create --ephemeral --title \"cleanup:\u003cname\u003e\" \\\n  --description \"Zombie detected: session dead, state=\u003cagent_state\u003e\" \\\n  --labels cleanup,polecat:\u003cname\u003e,state:zombie-detected\n```\n\n**Step 3: For running polecats (with LIVE session), assess progress**\n\nCheck the hook_bead field to see what they're working on:\n```bash\nbd show \u003chook_bead\u003e  # See current step/issue\n```\n\nYou can also verify they're responsive:\n```bash\ngt peek \u003crig\u003e/\u003cname\u003e 20\n```\n\nLook for:\n- Recent tool activity → making progress\n- Idle at prompt → may need nudge\n- Error messages → may need help\n\n**Step 3a: For idle polecats, auto-nuke if clean**\n\nWhen agent_state=idle, the polecat has no work assigned. Check if it's safe to nuke:\n\n```bash\n# Check git status in the polecat's worktree\ncd polecats/\u003cname\u003e\ngit status --porcelain         # Should be empty (clean)\ngit log @{u}..HEAD      # Should have no unpushed commits\n```\n\n**If clean** (no uncommitted changes, no unpushed commits):\n```bash\n# Safe to nuke - no work to lose\ngt polecat nuke \u003cname\u003e\n```\nLog the auto-nuke for audit purposes. No escalation needed.\n\n**If dirty** (uncommitted or unpushed work):\n```bash\n# Escalate to Deacon - polecat has work that might be valuable\ngt mail send deacon/ -s \\\"IDLE_DIRTY: \u003cpolecat\u003e has uncommitted work\\\" \\\n  -m \\\"Polecat: \u003cname\u003e\nState: idle (no hook_bead)\nGit status: \u003cuncommitted-files\u003e\nUnpushed commits: \u003ccount\u003e\n\nPlease advise: recover work or discard?\\\"\n```\n\n**Rationale**: Idle polecats with clean git state are pure overhead. They have\nno work and no state worth preserving. Nuking them immediately frees resources\nand reduces noise. Only escalate when there's actual work at risk.\n\n**Step 4: Decide action**\n\n| Observation | Action |\n|-------------|--------|\n| agent_state=running, session alive, recent activity | None |\n| agent_state=running, session alive, idle 5-15 min | Gentle nudge |\n| agent_state=running, session alive, idle 15+ min | Direct nudge with deadline |\n| agent_state=running, SESSION DEAD | ZOMBIE — handle in Step 2a |\n| agent_state=stuck | Assess and help or escalate |\n| agent_state=done | Verify cleanup triggered (see Step 4a) |\n\n**Step 4a: Handle agent_state=done**\n\nIn the ephemeral model, polecats with agent_state=done and cleanup_status=clean\nshould already be nuked by HandlePolecatDone. Finding one here indicates:\n\n1. **Stale agent bead** - polecat was nuked but bead remains\n   ```bash\n   # Verify polecat doesn't exist anymore\n   ls polecats/\u003cname\u003e 2\u003e/dev/null || echo \"Already nuked\"\n   ```\n   If nuked, the agent bead is stale. Clean it up or ignore.\n\n2. **Cleanup wisp exists** - polecat has dirty state needing intervention\n   ```bash\n   bd list --label polecat:\u003cname\u003e --status=open\n   ```\n   Process in process-cleanups step.\n\n3. **No wisp, polecat exists** - POLECAT_DONE mail was missed\n   Try auto-nuke directly (ephemeral model):\n   ```bash\n   # Check cleanup_status and nuke if clean\n   gt polecat nuke \u003cname\u003e  # Will fail if dirty\n   ```\n   If nuke fails (dirty state), create cleanup wisp for investigation.\n\n**Step 5: Execute nudges**\n```bash\n# Use --mode=queue to avoid interrupting in-flight tool calls\ngt nudge --mode=queue \u003crig\u003e/polecats/\u003cname\u003e \"How's progress? Need help?\"\n```\n\n**Step 6: Escalate if needed**\n```bash\ngt mail send deacon/ -s \"Escalation: \u003cpolecat\u003e stuck\" \\\n  -m \"Polecat \u003cname\u003e reports stuck. Please intervene.\"\n```\n\n**Parallelism**: Use Task tool subagents to inspect multiple polecats concurrently.\n\n**ZFC Principle**: Trust agent_state from beads for WHAT agents report. But\nverify tmux session existence for WHETHER agents are alive. A dead session with\nagent_state=running is a zombie — the agent cannot correct its own state.\n\n**Step 7: ORPHANED BEAD DETECTION — Scan from beads side**\n\n🚨 **CRITICAL**: Zombie detection (Step 2a) scans FROM polecat directories.\nOnce a polecat is nuked and its directory removed, its beads become invisible\nto zombie detection. Orphaned bead detection scans FROM beads to catch this case.\n\n```bash\nbd list --status=in_progress --json --limit=0\nbd list --status=hooked --json --limit=0\n```\n\nFor each in_progress or hooked bead with a polecat assignee (format: `\u003crig\u003e/polecats/\u003cname\u003e`):\n1. Only check beads assigned to polecats in YOUR rig\n2. Check tmux session: `gt session status \u003crig\u003e/\u003cname\u003e --json | jq -r '.running'`\n3. Check polecat directory: `ls \u003crig\u003e/polecats/\u003cname\u003e 2\u003e/dev/null`\n4. If BOTH session dead AND directory missing → orphan. Reset the bead:\n   ```bash\n   bd update \u003cbead-id\u003e --status=open --assignee=\n   gt mail send deacon/ -s \"ORPHAN_RECOVERED: \u003cbead-id\u003e\" \\\n     -m \"Bead \u003cbead-id\u003e was assigned to \u003crig\u003e/polecats/\u003cname\u003e which no longer exists.\n   The bead has been reset to open with no assignee.\n   Please re-dispatch to an available polecat.\"\n   ```\n5. If directory exists but session dead → skip (zombie detection handles it)\n6.

Check if it's safe to nuke:\n\n```bash\n# Check git status in the polecat's worktree\ncd polecats/\u003cname\u003e\ngit status --porcelain         # Should be empty (clean)\ngit log @{u}..HEAD      # Should have no unpushed commits\n```\n\n**If clean** (no uncommitted changes, no unpushed commits):\n```bash\n# Safe to nuke - no work to lose\ngt polecat nuke \u003cname\u003e\n```\nLog the auto-nuke for audit purposes. No escalation needed.\n\n**If dirty** (uncommitted or unpushed work):\n```bash\n# Escalate to Deacon - polecat has work that might be valuable\ngt mail send deacon/ -s \\\"IDLE_DIRTY: \u003cpolecat\u003e has uncommitted work\\\" \\\n  -m \\\"Polecat: \u003cname\u003e\nState: idle (no hook_bead)\nGit status: \u003cuncommitted-files\u003e\nUnpushed commits: \u003ccount\u003e\n\nPlease advise: recover work or discard?\\\"\n```\n\n**Rationale**: Idle polecats with clean git state are pure overhead. They have\nno work and no state worth preserving. Nuking them immediately frees resources\nand reduces noise. Only escalate when there's actual work at risk.\n\n**Step 4: Decide action**\n\n| Observation | Action |\n|-------------|--------|\n| agent_state=running, session alive, recent activity | None |\n| agent_state=running, session alive, idle 5-15 min | Gentle nudge |\n| agent_state=running, session alive, idle 15+ min | Direct nudge with deadline |\n| agent_state=running, SESSION DEAD | ZOMBIE — handle in Step 2a |\n| agent_state=stuck | Assess and help or escalate |\n| agent_state=done | Verify cleanup triggered (see Step 4a) |\n\n**Step 4a: Handle agent_state=done**\n\nIn the ephemeral model, polecats with agent_state=done and cleanup_status=clean\nshould already be nuked by HandlePolecatDone. Finding one here indicates:\n\n1. **Stale agent bead** - polecat was nuked but bead remains\n   ```bash\n   # Verify polecat doesn't exist anymore\n   ls polecats/\u003cname\u003e 2\u003e/dev/null || echo \"Already nuked\"\n   ```\n   If nuked, the agent bead is stale. Clean it up or ignore.\n\n2. **Cleanup wisp exists** - polecat has dirty state needing intervention\n   ```bash\n   bd list --label polecat:\u003cname\u003e --status=open\n   ```\n   Process in process-cleanups step.\n\n3. **No wisp, polecat exists** - POLECAT_DONE mail was missed\n   Try auto-nuke directly (ephemeral model):\n   ```bash\n   # Check cleanup_status and nuke if clean\n   gt polecat nuke \u003cname\u003e  # Will fail if dirty\n   ```\n   If nuke fails (dirty state), create cleanup wisp for investigation.\n\n**Step 5: Execute nudges**\n```bash\n# Use --mode=queue to avoid interrupting in-flight tool calls\ngt nudge --mode=queue \u003crig\u003e/polecats/\u003cname\u003e \"How's progress? Need help?\"\n```\n\n**Step 6: Escalate if needed**\n```bash\ngt mail send deacon/ -s \"Escalation: \u003cpolecat\u003e stuck\" \\\n  -m \"Polecat \u003cname\u003e reports stuck. Please intervene.\"\n```\n\n**Parallelism**: Use Task tool subagents to inspect multiple polecats concurrently.\n\n**ZFC Principle**: Trust agent_state from beads for WHAT agents report. But\nverify tmux session existence for WHETHER agents are alive. A dead session with\nagent_state=running is a zombie — the agent cannot correct its own state.\n\n**Step 7: ORPHANED BEAD DETECTION — Scan from beads side**\n\n🚨 **CRITICAL**: Zombie detection (Step 2a) scans FROM polecat directories.\nOnce a polecat is nuked and its directory removed, its beads become invisible\nto zombie detection. Orphaned bead detection scans FROM beads to catch this case.\n\n```bash\nbd list --status=in_progress --json --limit=0\nbd list --status=hooked --json --limit=0\n```\n\nFor each in_progress or hooked bead with a polecat assignee (format: `\u003crig\u003e/polecats/\u003cname\u003e`):\n1. Only check beads assigned to polecats in YOUR rig\n2. Check tmux session: `gt session status \u003crig\u003e/\u003cname\u003e --json | jq -r '.running'`\n3. Check polecat directory: `ls \u003crig\u003e/polecats/\u003cname\u003e 2\u003e/dev/null`\n4. If BOTH session dead AND directory missing → orphan. Reset the bead:\n   ```bash\n   bd update \u003cbead-id\u003e --status=open --assignee=\n   gt mail send deacon/ -s \"ORPHAN_RECOVERED: \u003cbead-id\u003e\" \\\n     -m \"Bead \u003cbead-id\u003e was assigned to \u003crig\u003e/polecats/\u003cname\u003e which no longer exists.\n   The bead has been reset to open with no assignee.\n   Please re-dispatch to an available polecat.\"\n   ```\n5.

Check git state to determine if work is recoverable:\n```bash\ncd polecats/\u003cname\u003e/\u003crig\u003e\ngit status --porcelain         # Uncommitted changes?\ngit log @{u}..HEAD      # Unpushed commits?\n```\n\n2. **If clean** (no uncommitted, no unpushed): Auto-nuke immediately.\n```bash\ngt polecat nuke \u003cname\u003e\n```\n\n3. **If dirty** (has unpushed/uncommitted work): Escalate to Deacon for recovery.\n```bash\ngt mail send deacon/ -s \"RECOVERY_NEEDED \u003crig\u003e/\u003cname\u003e\" \\\n  -m \"Polecat: \u003crig\u003e/\u003cname\u003e\nCleanup Status: \u003chas_uncommitted|has_unpushed|has_stash\u003e\nHook Bead: \u003chook_bead\u003e\nDetected: $(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)\n\nZombie detected: tmux session dead, agent_state=\u003cstate\u003e.\nThis polecat has unpushed/uncommitted work that will be lost if nuked.\nPlease coordinate recovery before authorizing cleanup.\"\n```\n\nAlso create a cleanup wisp for tracking:\n```bash\nbd create --ephemeral --title \"cleanup:\u003cname\u003e\" \\\n  --description \"Zombie detected: session dead, state=\u003cagent_state\u003e\" \\\n  --labels cleanup,polecat:\u003cname\u003e,state:zombie-detected\n```\n\n**Step 3: For running polecats (with LIVE session), assess progress**\n\nCheck the hook_bead field to see what they're working on:\n```bash\nbd show \u003chook_bead\u003e  # See current step/issue\n```\n\nYou can also verify they're responsive:\n```bash\ngt peek \u003crig\u003e/\u003cname\u003e 20\n```\n\nLook for:\n- Recent tool activity → making progress\n- Idle at prompt → may need nudge\n- Error messages → may need help\n\n**Step 3a: For idle polecats, auto-nuke if clean**\n\nWhen agent_state=idle, the polecat has no work assigned. Check if it's safe to nuke:\n\n```bash\n# Check git status in the polecat's worktree\ncd polecats/\u003cname\u003e\ngit status --porcelain         # Should be empty (clean)\ngit log @{u}..HEAD      # Should have no unpushed commits\n```\n\n**If clean** (no uncommitted changes, no unpushed commits):\n```bash\n# Safe to nuke - no work to lose\ngt polecat nuke \u003cname\u003e\n```\nLog the auto-nuke for audit purposes. No escalation needed.\n\n**If dirty** (uncommitted or unpushed work):\n```bash\n# Escalate to Deacon - polecat has work that might be valuable\ngt mail send deacon/ -s \\\"IDLE_DIRTY: \u003cpolecat\u003e has uncommitted work\\\" \\\n  -m \\\"Polecat: \u003cname\u003e\nState: idle (no hook_bead)\nGit status: \u003cuncommitted-files\u003e\nUnpushed commits: \u003ccount\u003e\n\nPlease advise: recover work or discard?\\\"\n```\n\n**Rationale**: Idle polecats with clean git state are pure overhead. They have\nno work and no state worth preserving. Nuking them immediately frees resources\nand reduces noise. Only escalate when there's actual work at risk.\n\n**Step 4: Decide action**\n\n| Observation | Action |\n|-------------|--------|\n| agent_state=running, session alive, recent activity | None |\n| agent_state=running, session alive, idle 5-15 min | Gentle nudge |\n| agent_state=running, session alive, idle 15+ min | Direct nudge with deadline |\n| agent_state=running, SESSION DEAD | ZOMBIE — handle in Step 2a |\n| agent_state=stuck | Assess and help or escalate |\n| agent_state=done | Verify cleanup triggered (see Step 4a) |\n\n**Step 4a: Handle agent_state=done**\n\nIn the ephemeral model, polecats with agent_state=done and cleanup_status=clean\nshould already be nuked by HandlePolecatDone. Finding one here indicates:\n\n1. **Stale agent bead** - polecat was nuked but bead remains\n   ```bash\n   # Verify polecat doesn't exist anymore\n   ls polecats/\u003cname\u003e 2\u003e/dev/null || echo \"Already nuked\"\n   ```\n   If nuked, the agent bead is stale. Clean it up or ignore.\n\n2. **Cleanup wisp exists** - polecat has dirty state needing intervention\n   ```bash\n   bd list --label polecat:\u003cname\u003e --status=open\n   ```\n   Process in process-cleanups step.\n\n3. **No wisp, polecat exists** - POLECAT_DONE mail was missed\n   Try auto-nuke directly (ephemeral model):\n   ```bash\n   # Check cleanup_status and nuke if clean\n   gt polecat nuke \u003cname\u003e  # Will fail if dirty\n   ```\n   If nuke fails (dirty state), create cleanup wisp for investigation.\n\n**Step 5: Execute nudges**\n```bash\n# Use --mode=queue to avoid interrupting in-flight tool calls\ngt nudge --mode=queue \u003crig\u003e/polecats/\u003cname\u003e \"How's progress? Need help?\"\n```\n\n**Step 6: Escalate if needed**\n```bash\ngt mail send deacon/ -s \"Escalation: \u003cpolecat\u003e stuck\" \\\n  -m \"Polecat \u003cname\u003e reports stuck. Please intervene.\"\n```\n\n**Parallelism**: Use Task tool subagents to inspect multiple polecats concurrently.\n\n**ZFC Principle**: Trust agent_state from beads for WHAT agents report. But\nverify tmux session existence for WHETHER agents are alive. A dead session with\nagent_state=running is a zombie — the agent cannot correct its own state.\n\n**Step 7: ORPHANED BEAD DETECTION — Scan from beads side**\n\n🚨 **CRITICAL**: Zombie detection (Step 2a) scans FROM polecat directories.\nOnce a polecat is nuked and its directory removed, its beads become invisible\nto zombie detection. Orphaned bead detection scans FROM beads to catch this case.\n\n```bash\nbd list --status=in_progress --json --limit=0\nbd list --status=hooked --json --limit=0\n```\n\nFor each in_progress or hooked bead with a polecat assignee (format: `\u003crig\u003e/polecats/\u003cname\u003e`):\n1. Only check beads assigned to polecats in YOUR rig\n2. Check tmux session: `gt session status \u003crig\u003e/\u003cname\u003e --json | jq -r '.running'`\n3. Check polecat directory: `ls \u003crig\u003e/polecats/\u003cname\u003e 2\u003e/dev/null`\n4. If BOTH session dead AND directory missing → orphan. Reset the bead:\n   ```bash\n   bd update \u003cbead-id\u003e --status=open --assignee=\n   gt mail send deacon/ -s \"ORPHAN_RECOVERED: \u003cbead-id\u003e\" \\\n     -m \"Bead \u003cbead-id\u003e was assigned to \u003crig\u003e/polecats/\u003cname\u003e which no longer exists.\n   The bead has been reset to open with no assignee.\n   Please re-dispatch to an available polecat.\"\n   ```\n5. If directory exists but session dead → skip (zombie detection handles it)\n6.

Check the MR's target field and use\nthat as the merge destination. Only fall back to main if no explicit target is set.\n\n**Step 1: Merge and Push**\nDetermine the merge target: use the MR's target field if set, otherwise main.\n```bash\ngit checkout \u003cmerge-target\u003e\ngit merge --ff-only temp\ngit push origin \u003cmerge-target\u003e\n```\n\n**Step 1.5: VERIFY PUSH SUCCEEDED (CRITICAL - PATCH-003)**\n\nPush can fail silently (network, auth, hooks).

A polecat with agent_state=running\nor hook_bead assigned but NO tmux session is a zombie that will sit forever\nundetected unless you proactively check.\n\nFor EVERY polecat with agent_state=running/working OR hook_bead assigned:\n```bash\ngt session status \u003crig\u003e/\u003cname\u003e --json | jq -r '.running' | grep -q true \u0026\u0026 echo ALIVE || echo ZOMBIE\n```\n\n**If ZOMBIE detected** (session missing, agent says working):\n\n1. Check git state to determine if work is recoverable:\n```bash\ncd polecats/\u003cname\u003e/\u003crig\u003e\ngit status --porcelain         # Uncommitted changes?\ngit log @{u}..HEAD      # Unpushed commits?\n```\n\n2. **If clean** (no uncommitted, no unpushed): Auto-nuke immediately.\n```bash\ngt polecat nuke \u003cname\u003e\n```\n\n3. **If dirty** (has unpushed/uncommitted work): Escalate to Deacon for recovery.\n```bash\ngt mail send deacon/ -s \"RECOVERY_NEEDED \u003crig\u003e/\u003cname\u003e\" \\\n  -m \"Polecat: \u003crig\u003e/\u003cname\u003e\nCleanup Status: \u003chas_uncommitted|has_unpushed|has_stash\u003e\nHook Bead: \u003chook_bead\u003e\nDetected: $(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)\n\nZombie detected: tmux session dead, agent_state=\u003cstate\u003e.\nThis polecat has unpushed/uncommitted work that will be lost if nuked.\nPlease coordinate recovery before authorizing cleanup.\"\n```\n\nAlso create a cleanup wisp for tracking:\n```bash\nbd create --ephemeral --title \"cleanup:\u003cname\u003e\" \\\n  --description \"Zombie detected: session dead, state=\u003cagent_state\u003e\" \\\n  --labels cleanup,polecat:\u003cname\u003e,state:zombie-detected\n```\n\n**Step 3: For running polecats (with LIVE session), assess progress**\n\nCheck the hook_bead field to see what they're working on:\n```bash\nbd show \u003chook_bead\u003e  # See current step/issue\n```\n\nYou can also verify they're responsive:\n```bash\ngt peek \u003crig\u003e/\u003cname\u003e 20\n```\n\nLook for:\n- Recent tool activity → making progress\n- Idle at prompt → may need nudge\n- Error messages → may need help\n\n**Step 3a: For idle polecats, auto-nuke if clean**\n\nWhen agent_state=idle, the polecat has no work assigned. Check if it's safe to nuke:\n\n```bash\n# Check git status in the polecat's worktree\ncd polecats/\u003cname\u003e\ngit status --porcelain         # Should be empty (clean)\ngit log @{u}..HEAD      # Should have no unpushed commits\n```\n\n**If clean** (no uncommitted changes, no unpushed commits):\n```bash\n# Safe to nuke - no work to lose\ngt polecat nuke \u003cname\u003e\n```\nLog the auto-nuke for audit purposes. No escalation needed.\n\n**If dirty** (uncommitted or unpushed work):\n```bash\n# Escalate to Deacon - polecat has work that might be valuable\ngt mail send deacon/ -s \\\"IDLE_DIRTY: \u003cpolecat\u003e has uncommitted work\\\" \\\n  -m \\\"Polecat: \u003cname\u003e\nState: idle (no hook_bead)\nGit status: \u003cuncommitted-files\u003e\nUnpushed commits: \u003ccount\u003e\n\nPlease advise: recover work or discard?\\\"\n```\n\n**Rationale**: Idle polecats with clean git state are pure overhead. They have\nno work and no state worth preserving. Nuking them immediately frees resources\nand reduces noise. Only escalate when there's actual work at risk.\n\n**Step 4: Decide action**\n\n| Observation | Action |\n|-------------|--------|\n| agent_state=running, session alive, recent activity | None |\n| agent_state=running, session alive, idle 5-15 min | Gentle nudge |\n| agent_state=running, session alive, idle 15+ min | Direct nudge with deadline |\n| agent_state=running, SESSION DEAD | ZOMBIE — handle in Step 2a |\n| agent_state=stuck | Assess and help or escalate |\n| agent_state=done | Verify cleanup triggered (see Step 4a) |\n\n**Step 4a: Handle agent_state=done**\n\nIn the ephemeral model, polecats with agent_state=done and cleanup_status=clean\nshould already be nuked by HandlePolecatDone. Finding one here indicates:\n\n1. **Stale agent bead** - polecat was nuked but bead remains\n   ```bash\n   # Verify polecat doesn't exist anymore\n   ls polecats/\u003cname\u003e 2\u003e/dev/null || echo \"Already nuked\"\n   ```\n   If nuked, the agent bead is stale. Clean it up or ignore.\n\n2. **Cleanup wisp exists** - polecat has dirty state needing intervention\n   ```bash\n   bd list --label polecat:\u003cname\u003e --status=open\n   ```\n   Process in process-cleanups step.\n\n3. **No wisp, polecat exists** - POLECAT_DONE mail was missed\n   Try auto-nuke directly (ephemeral model):\n   ```bash\n   # Check cleanup_status and nuke if clean\n   gt polecat nuke \u003cname\u003e  # Will fail if dirty\n   ```\n   If nuke fails (dirty state), create cleanup wisp for investigation.\n\n**Step 5: Execute nudges**\n```bash\n# Use --mode=queue to avoid interrupting in-flight tool calls\ngt nudge --mode=queue \u003crig\u003e/polecats/\u003cname\u003e \"How's progress? Need help?\"\n```\n\n**Step 6: Escalate if needed**\n```bash\ngt mail send deacon/ -s \"Escalation: \u003cpolecat\u003e stuck\" \\\n  -m \"Polecat \u003cname\u003e reports stuck. Please intervene.\"\n```\n\n**Parallelism**: Use Task tool subagents to inspect multiple polecats concurrently.\n\n**ZFC Principle**: Trust agent_state from beads for WHAT agents report. But\nverify tmux session existence for WHETHER agents are alive. A dead session with\nagent_state=running is a zombie — the agent cannot correct its own state.\n\n**Step 7: ORPHANED BEAD DETECTION — Scan from beads side**\n\n🚨 **CRITICAL**: Zombie detection (Step 2a) scans FROM polecat directories.\nOnce a polecat is nuked and its directory removed, its beads become invisible\nto zombie detection. Orphaned bead detection scans FROM beads to catch this case.\n\n```bash\nbd list --status=in_progress --json --limit=0\nbd list --status=hooked --json --limit=0\n```\n\nFor each in_progress or hooked bead with a polecat assignee (format: `\u003crig\u003e/polecats/\u003cname\u003e`):\n1. Only check beads assigned to polecats in YOUR rig\n2. Check tmux session: `gt session status \u003crig\u003e/\u003cname\u003e --json | jq -r '.running'`\n3. Check polecat directory: `ls \u003crig\u003e/polecats/\u003cname\u003e 2\u003e/dev/null`\n4. If BOTH session dead AND directory missing → orphan. Reset the bead:\n   ```bash\n   bd update \u003cbead-id\u003e --status=open --assignee=\n   gt mail send deacon/ -s \"ORPHAN_RECOVERED: \u003cbead-id\u003e\" \\\n     -m \"Bead \u003cbead-id\u003e was assigned to \u003crig\u003e/polecats/\u003cname\u003e which no longer exists.\n   The bead has been reset to open with no assignee.\n   Please re-dispatch to an available polecat.\"\n   ```\n5. If directory exists but session dead → skip (zombie detection handles it)\n6.

Reports summary of gate status\n\n**Step 2: Review output**\n\nIf expired gates were found and escalated:\n- The escalation creates an audit trail bead\n- Overseer will be notified via mail\n- Gate remains open until manually resolved\n\nIf no expired gates:\n- Continue patrol normally\n\n**Note**: Timer gates do NOT auto-close on expiration. They escalate.\nThis ensures human oversight of timeout conditions.\n\n**Parallelism**: This is a single command, no parallel execution needed.","design":"","due_at":null,"ephemeral":0,"estimated_minutes":null,"event_kind":"","external_ref":null,"hook_bead":"","id":"gt-mol-weayr","is_template":0,"issue_type":"task","last_activity":null,"metadata":"{}","mol_type":"","notes":"","original_size":null,"owner":"","payload":"","pinned":0,"priority":2,"quality_score":null,"rig":"","role_bead":"","role_type":"","sender":"","source_repo":"","source_system":"","spec_id":"","status":"closed","target":"","timeout_ns":0,"title":"Check timer gates for expiration","updated_at":"2026-02-22T15:50:43Z","waiters":"","wisp_type":"","work_type":""}

A polecat with agent_state=running\nor hook_bead assigned but NO tmux session is a zombie that will sit forever\nundetected unless you proactively check.\n\nFor EVERY polecat with agent_state=running/working OR hook_bead assigned:\n```bash\ngt session status \u003crig\u003e/\u003cname\u003e --json | jq -r '.running' | grep -q true \u0026\u0026 echo ALIVE || echo ZOMBIE\n```\n\n**If ZOMBIE detected** (session missing, agent says working):\n\n1. Check git state to determine if work is recoverable:\n```bash\ncd polecats/\u003cname\u003e/\u003crig\u003e\ngit status --porcelain         # Uncommitted changes?\ngit log @{u}..HEAD      # Unpushed commits?\n```\n\n2. **If clean** (no uncommitted, no unpushed): Auto-nuke immediately.\n```bash\ngt polecat nuke \u003cname\u003e\n```\n\n3. **If dirty** (has unpushed/uncommitted work): Escalate to Deacon for recovery.\n```bash\ngt mail send deacon/ -s \"RECOVERY_NEEDED \u003crig\u003e/\u003cname\u003e\" \\\n  -m \"Polecat: \u003crig\u003e/\u003cname\u003e\nCleanup Status: \u003chas_uncommitted|has_unpushed|has_stash\u003e\nHook Bead: \u003chook_bead\u003e\nDetected: $(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)\n\nZombie detected: tmux session dead, agent_state=\u003cstate\u003e.\nThis polecat has unpushed/uncommitted work that will be lost if nuked.\nPlease coordinate recovery before authorizing cleanup.\"\n```\n\nAlso create a cleanup wisp for tracking:\n```bash\nbd create --ephemeral --title \"cleanup:\u003cname\u003e\" \\\n  --description \"Zombie detected: session dead, state=\u003cagent_state\u003e\" \\\n  --labels cleanup,polecat:\u003cname\u003e,state:zombie-detected\n```\n\n**Step 3: For running polecats (with LIVE session), assess progress**\n\nCheck the hook_bead field to see what they're working on:\n```bash\nbd show \u003chook_bead\u003e  # See current step/issue\n```\n\nYou can also verify they're responsive:\n```bash\ngt peek \u003crig\u003e/\u003cname\u003e 20\n```\n\nLook for:\n- Recent tool activity → making progress\n- Idle at prompt → may need nudge\n- Error messages → may need help\n\n**Step 3a: For idle polecats, auto-nuke if clean**\n\nWhen agent_state=idle, the polecat has no work assigned. Check if it's safe to nuke:\n\n```bash\n# Check git status in the polecat's worktree\ncd polecats/\u003cname\u003e\ngit status --porcelain         # Should be empty (clean)\ngit log @{u}..HEAD      # Should have no unpushed commits\n```\n\n**If clean** (no uncommitted changes, no unpushed commits):\n```bash\n# Safe to nuke - no work to lose\ngt polecat nuke \u003cname\u003e\n```\nLog the auto-nuke for audit purposes. No escalation needed.\n\n**If dirty** (uncommitted or unpushed work):\n```bash\n# Escalate to Deacon - polecat has work that might be valuable\ngt mail send deacon/ -s \\\"IDLE_DIRTY: \u003cpolecat\u003e has uncommitted work\\\" \\\n  -m \\\"Polecat: \u003cname\u003e\nState: idle (no hook_bead)\nGit status: \u003cuncommitted-files\u003e\nUnpushed commits: \u003ccount\u003e\n\nPlease advise: recover work or discard?\\\"\n```\n\n**Rationale**: Idle polecats with clean git state are pure overhead. They have\nno work and no state worth preserving. Nuking them immediately frees resources\nand reduces noise. Only escalate when there's actual work at risk.\n\n**Step 4: Decide action**\n\n| Observation | Action |\n|-------------|--------|\n| agent_state=running, session alive, recent activity | None |\n| agent_state=running, session alive, idle 5-15 min | Gentle nudge |\n| agent_state=running, session alive, idle 15+ min | Direct nudge with deadline |\n| agent_state=running, SESSION DEAD | ZOMBIE — handle in Step 2a |\n| agent_state=stuck | Assess and help or escalate |\n| agent_state=done | Verify cleanup triggered (see Step 4a) |\n\n**Step 4a: Handle agent_state=done**\n\nIn the ephemeral model, polecats with agent_state=done and cleanup_status=clean\nshould already be nuked by HandlePolecatDone. Finding one here indicates:\n\n1. **Stale agent bead** - polecat was nuked but bead remains\n   ```bash\n   # Verify polecat doesn't exist anymore\n   ls polecats/\u003cname\u003e 2\u003e/dev/null || echo \"Already nuked\"\n   ```\n   If nuked, the agent bead is stale. Clean it up or ignore.\n\n2. **Cleanup wisp exists** - polecat has dirty state needing intervention\n   ```bash\n   bd list --label polecat:\u003cname\u003e --status=open\n   ```\n   Process in process-cleanups step.\n\n3. **No wisp, polecat exists** - POLECAT_DONE mail was missed\n   Try auto-nuke directly (ephemeral model):\n   ```bash\n   # Check cleanup_status and nuke if clean\n   gt polecat nuke \u003cname\u003e  # Will fail if dirty\n   ```\n   If nuke fails (dirty state), create cleanup wisp for investigation.\n\n**Step 5: Execute nudges**\n```bash\n# Use --mode=queue to avoid interrupting in-flight tool calls\ngt nudge --mode=queue \u003crig\u003e/polecats/\u003cname\u003e \"How's progress? Need help?\"\n```\n\n**Step 6: Escalate if needed**\n```bash\ngt mail send deacon/ -s \"Escalation: \u003cpolecat\u003e stuck\" \\\n  -m \"Polecat \u003cname\u003e reports stuck. Please intervene.\"\n```\n\n**Parallelism**: Use Task tool subagents to inspect multiple polecats concurrently.\n\n**ZFC Principle**: Trust agent_state from beads for WHAT agents report. But\nverify tmux session existence for WHETHER agents are alive. A dead session with\nagent_state=running is a zombie — the agent cannot correct its own state.\n\n**Step 7: ORPHANED BEAD DETECTION — Scan from beads side**\n\n🚨 **CRITICAL**: Zombie detection (Step 2a) scans FROM polecat directories.\nOnce a polecat is nuked and its directory removed, its beads become invisible\nto zombie detection. Orphaned bead detection scans FROM beads to catch this case.\n\n```bash\nbd list --status=in_progress --json --limit=0\nbd list --status=hooked --json --limit=0\n```\n\nFor each in_progress or hooked bead with a polecat assignee (format: `\u003crig\u003e/polecats/\u003cname\u003e`):\n1. Only check beads assigned to polecats in YOUR rig\n2. Check tmux session: `gt session status \u003crig\u003e/\u003cname\u003e --json | jq -r '.running'`\n3. Check polecat directory: `ls \u003crig\u003e/polecats/\u003cname\u003e 2\u003e/dev/null`\n4. If BOTH session dead AND directory missing → orphan. Reset the bead:\n   ```bash\n   bd update \u003cbead-id\u003e --status=open --assignee=\n   gt mail send deacon/ -s \"ORPHAN_RECOVERED: \u003cbead-id\u003e\" \\\n     -m \"Bead \u003cbead-id\u003e was assigned to \u003crig\u003e/polecats/\u003cname\u003e which no longer exists.\n   The bead has been reset to open with no assignee.\n   Please re-dispatch to an available polecat.\"\n   ```\n5. If directory exists but session dead → skip (zombie detection handles it)\n6. If session alive → not an orphan, skip\n\n**Step 8: File likely GT bugs discovered during patrol**\n\nWhen findings look like platform/tooling defects (not ordinary stuck-worker situations), file a bug bead before or alongside escalation:\n\n```bash\nbd create --rig \u003crig\u003e --type bug --priority 1 \\\n  --title \"Witness patrol bug: \u003cshort symptom\u003e\" \\\n  --description \"Detected by \u003crig\u003e/witness during survey-workers.\nSymptoms: \u003cwhat failed\u003e\nContext: \u003cpolecat/issue IDs, command output\u003e\nReproduction: \u003cminimal steps\u003e\"\n```\n\nExamples: duplicate dispatch behavior, cleanup_status false alarms, branch-name handling regressions, unexpected destructive nuke behavior.","design":"","due_at":null,"ephemeral":0,"estimated_minutes":null,"event_kind":"","external_ref":null,"hook_bead":"","id":"gt-mol-xddqd","is_template":0,"issue_type":"task","last_activity":null,"metadata":"{}","mol_type":"","notes":"","original_size":null,"owner":"","payload":"","pinned":0,"priority":2,"quality_score":null,"rig":"","role_bead":"","role_type":"","sender":"","source_repo":"","source_system":"","spec_id":"","status":"closed","target":"","timeout_ns":0,"title":"Inspect all active polecats","updated_at":"2026-02-23T19:19:21Z","waiters":"","wisp_type":"","work_type":""}

Check if it's safe to nuke:\n\n```bash\n# Check git status in the polecat's worktree\ncd polecats/\u003cname\u003e\ngit status --porcelain         # Should be empty (clean)\ngit log @{u}..HEAD      # Should have no unpushed commits\n```\n\n**If clean** (no uncommitted changes, no unpushed commits):\n```bash\n# Safe to nuke - no work to lose\ngt polecat nuke \u003cname\u003e\n```\nLog the auto-nuke for audit purposes. No escalation needed.\n\n**If dirty** (uncommitted or unpushed work):\n```bash\n# Escalate to Deacon - polecat has work that might be valuable\ngt mail send deacon/ -s \\\"IDLE_DIRTY: \u003cpolecat\u003e has uncommitted work\\\" \\\n  -m \\\"Polecat: \u003cname\u003e\nState: idle (no hook_bead)\nGit status: \u003cuncommitted-files\u003e\nUnpushed commits: \u003ccount\u003e\n\nPlease advise: recover work or discard?\\\"\n```\n\n**Rationale**: Idle polecats with clean git state are pure overhead. They have\nno work and no state worth preserving. Nuking them immediately frees resources\nand reduces noise. Only escalate when there's actual work at risk.\n\n**Step 4: Decide action**\n\n| Observation | Action |\n|-------------|--------|\n| agent_state=running, session alive, recent activity | None |\n| agent_state=running, session alive, idle 5-15 min | Gentle nudge |\n| agent_state=running, session alive, idle 15+ min | Direct nudge with deadline |\n| agent_state=running, SESSION DEAD | ZOMBIE — handle in Step 2a |\n| agent_state=stuck | Assess and help or escalate |\n| agent_state=done | Verify cleanup triggered (see Step 4a) |\n\n**Step 4a: Handle agent_state=done**\n\nIn the ephemeral model, polecats with agent_state=done and cleanup_status=clean\nshould already be nuked by HandlePolecatDone. Finding one here indicates:\n\n1. **Stale agent bead** - polecat was nuked but bead remains\n   ```bash\n   # Verify polecat doesn't exist anymore\n   ls polecats/\u003cname\u003e 2\u003e/dev/null || echo \"Already nuked\"\n   ```\n   If nuked, the agent bead is stale. Clean it up or ignore.\n\n2. **Cleanup wisp exists** - polecat has dirty state needing intervention\n   ```bash\n   bd list --label polecat:\u003cname\u003e --status=open\n   ```\n   Process in process-cleanups step.\n\n3. **No wisp, polecat exists** - POLECAT_DONE mail was missed\n   Try auto-nuke directly (ephemeral model):\n   ```bash\n   # Check cleanup_status and nuke if clean\n   gt polecat nuke \u003cname\u003e  # Will fail if dirty\n   ```\n   If nuke fails (dirty state), create cleanup wisp for investigation.\n\n**Step 5: Execute nudges**\n```bash\n# Use --mode=queue to avoid interrupting in-flight tool calls\ngt nudge --mode=queue \u003crig\u003e/polecats/\u003cname\u003e \"How's progress? Need help?\"\n```\n\n**Step 6: Escalate if needed**\n```bash\ngt mail send deacon/ -s \"Escalation: \u003cpolecat\u003e stuck\" \\\n  -m \"Polecat \u003cname\u003e reports stuck. Please intervene.\"\n```\n\n**Parallelism**: Use Task tool subagents to inspect multiple polecats concurrently.\n\n**ZFC Principle**: Trust agent_state from beads for WHAT agents report. But\nverify tmux session existence for WHETHER agents are alive. A dead session with\nagent_state=running is a zombie — the agent cannot correct its own state.\n\n**Step 7: ORPHANED BEAD DETECTION — Scan from beads side**\n\n🚨 **CRITICAL**: Zombie detection (Step 2a) scans FROM polecat directories.\nOnce a polecat is nuked and its directory removed, its beads become invisible\nto zombie detection. Orphaned bead detection scans FROM beads to catch this case.\n\n```bash\nbd list --status=in_progress --json --limit=0\nbd list --status=hooked --json --limit=0\n```\n\nFor each in_progress or hooked bead with a polecat assignee (format: `\u003crig\u003e/polecats/\u003cname\u003e`):\n1. Only check beads assigned to polecats in YOUR rig\n2. Check tmux session: `gt session status \u003crig\u003e/\u003cname\u003e --json | jq -r '.running'`\n3. Check polecat directory: `ls \u003crig\u003e/polecats/\u003cname\u003e 2\u003e/dev/null`\n4. If BOTH session dead AND directory missing → orphan. Reset the bead:\n   ```bash\n   bd update \u003cbead-id\u003e --status=open --assignee=\n   gt mail send deacon/ -s \"ORPHAN_RECOVERED: \u003cbead-id\u003e\" \\\n     -m \"Bead \u003cbead-id\u003e was assigned to \u003crig\u003e/polecats/\u003cname\u003e which no longer exists.\n   The bead has been reset to open with no assignee.\n   Please re-dispatch to an available polecat.\"\n   ```\n5.

A polecat with agent_state=running\nor hook_bead assigned but NO tmux session is a zombie that will sit forever\nundetected unless you proactively check.\n\nFor EVERY polecat with agent_state=running/working OR hook_bead assigned:\n```bash\ngt session status \u003crig\u003e/\u003cname\u003e --json | jq -r '.running' | grep -q true \u0026\u0026 echo ALIVE || echo ZOMBIE\n```\n\n**If ZOMBIE detected** (session missing, agent says working):\n\n1. Check git state to determine if work is recoverable:\n```bash\ncd polecats/\u003cname\u003e/\u003crig\u003e\ngit status --porcelain         # Uncommitted changes?\ngit log @{u}..HEAD      # Unpushed commits?\n```\n\n2. **If clean** (no uncommitted, no unpushed): Auto-nuke immediately.\n```bash\ngt polecat nuke \u003cname\u003e\n```\n\n3. **If dirty** (has unpushed/uncommitted work): Escalate to Deacon for recovery.\n```bash\ngt mail send deacon/ -s \"RECOVERY_NEEDED \u003crig\u003e/\u003cname\u003e\" \\\n  -m \"Polecat: \u003crig\u003e/\u003cname\u003e\nCleanup Status: \u003chas_uncommitted|has_unpushed|has_stash\u003e\nHook Bead: \u003chook_bead\u003e\nDetected: $(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)\n\nZombie detected: tmux session dead, agent_state=\u003cstate\u003e.\nThis polecat has unpushed/uncommitted work that will be lost if nuked.\nPlease coordinate recovery before authorizing cleanup.\"\n```\n\nAlso create a cleanup wisp for tracking:\n```bash\nbd create --ephemeral --title \"cleanup:\u003cname\u003e\" \\\n  --description \"Zombie detected: session dead, state=\u003cagent_state\u003e\" \\\n  --labels cleanup,polecat:\u003cname\u003e,state:zombie-detected\n```\n\n**Step 3: For running polecats (with LIVE session), assess progress**\n\nCheck the hook_bead field to see what they're working on:\n```bash\nbd show \u003chook_bead\u003e  # See current step/issue\n```\n\nYou can also verify they're responsive:\n```bash\ngt peek \u003crig\u003e/\u003cname\u003e 20\n```\n\nLook for:\n- Recent tool activity → making progress\n- Idle at prompt → may need nudge\n- Error messages → may need help\n\n**Step 3a: For idle polecats, auto-nuke if clean**\n\nWhen agent_state=idle, the polecat has no work assigned. Check if it's safe to nuke:\n\n```bash\n# Check git status in the polecat's worktree\ncd polecats/\u003cname\u003e\ngit status --porcelain         # Should be empty (clean)\ngit log @{u}..HEAD      # Should have no unpushed commits\n```\n\n**If clean** (no uncommitted changes, no unpushed commits):\n```bash\n# Safe to nuke - no work to lose\ngt polecat nuke \u003cname\u003e\n```\nLog the auto-nuke for audit purposes. No escalation needed.\n\n**If dirty** (uncommitted or unpushed work):\n```bash\n# Escalate to Deacon - polecat has work that might be valuable\ngt mail send deacon/ -s \\\"IDLE_DIRTY: \u003cpolecat\u003e has uncommitted work\\\" \\\n  -m \\\"Polecat: \u003cname\u003e\nState: idle (no hook_bead)\nGit status: \u003cuncommitted-files\u003e\nUnpushed commits: \u003ccount\u003e\n\nPlease advise: recover work or discard?\\\"\n```\n\n**Rationale**: Idle polecats with clean git state are pure overhead. They have\nno work and no state worth preserving. Nuking them immediately frees resources\nand reduces noise. Only escalate when there's actual work at risk.\n\n**Step 4: Decide action**\n\n| Observation | Action |\n|-------------|--------|\n| agent_state=running, session alive, recent activity | None |\n| agent_state=running, session alive, idle 5-15 min | Gentle nudge |\n| agent_state=running, session alive, idle 15+ min | Direct nudge with deadline |\n| agent_state=running, SESSION DEAD | ZOMBIE — handle in Step 2a |\n| agent_state=stuck | Assess and help or escalate |\n| agent_state=done | Verify cleanup triggered (see Step 4a) |\n\n**Step 4a: Handle agent_state=done**\n\nIn the ephemeral model, polecats with agent_state=done and cleanup_status=clean\nshould already be nuked by HandlePolecatDone. Finding one here indicates:\n\n1. **Stale agent bead** - polecat was nuked but bead remains\n   ```bash\n   # Verify polecat doesn't exist anymore\n   ls polecats/\u003cname\u003e 2\u003e/dev/null || echo \"Already nuked\"\n   ```\n   If nuked, the agent bead is stale. Clean it up or ignore.\n\n2. **Cleanup wisp exists** - polecat has dirty state needing intervention\n   ```bash\n   bd list --label polecat:\u003cname\u003e --status=open\n   ```\n   Process in process-cleanups step.\n\n3. **No wisp, polecat exists** - POLECAT_DONE mail was missed\n   Try auto-nuke directly (ephemeral model):\n   ```bash\n   # Check cleanup_status and nuke if clean\n   gt polecat nuke \u003cname\u003e  # Will fail if dirty\n   ```\n   If nuke fails (dirty state), create cleanup wisp for investigation.\n\n**Step 5: Execute nudges**\n```bash\n# Use --mode=queue to avoid interrupting in-flight tool calls\ngt nudge --mode=queue \u003crig\u003e/polecats/\u003cname\u003e \"How's progress? Need help?\"\n```\n\n**Step 6: Escalate if needed**\n```bash\ngt mail send deacon/ -s \"Escalation: \u003cpolecat\u003e stuck\" \\\n  -m \"Polecat \u003cname\u003e reports stuck. Please intervene.\"\n```\n\n**Parallelism**: Use Task tool subagents to inspect multiple polecats concurrently.\n\n**ZFC Principle**: Trust agent_state from beads for WHAT agents report. But\nverify tmux session existence for WHETHER agents are alive. A dead session with\nagent_state=running is a zombie — the agent cannot correct its own state.\n\n**Step 7: ORPHANED BEAD DETECTION — Scan from beads side**\n\n🚨 **CRITICAL**: Zombie detection (Step 2a) scans FROM polecat directories.\nOnce a polecat is nuked and its directory removed, its beads become invisible\nto zombie detection. Orphaned bead detection scans FROM beads to catch this case.\n\n```bash\nbd list --status=in_progress --json --limit=0\nbd list --status=hooked --json --limit=0\n```\n\nFor each in_progress or hooked bead with a polecat assignee (format: `\u003crig\u003e/polecats/\u003cname\u003e`):\n1. Only check beads assigned to polecats in YOUR rig\n2. Check tmux session: `gt session status \u003crig\u003e/\u003cname\u003e --json | jq -r '.running'`\n3. Check polecat directory: `ls \u003crig\u003e/polecats/\u003cname\u003e 2\u003e/dev/null`\n4. If BOTH session dead AND directory missing → orphan. Reset the bead:\n   ```bash\n   bd update \u003cbead-id\u003e --status=open --assignee=\n   gt mail send deacon/ -s \"ORPHAN_RECOVERED: \u003cbead-id\u003e\" \\\n     -m \"Bead \u003cbead-id\u003e was assigned to \u003crig\u003e/polecats/\u003cname\u003e which no longer exists.\n   The bead has been reset to open with no assignee.\n   Please re-dispatch to an available polecat.\"\n   ```\n5. If directory exists but session dead → skip (zombie detection handles it)\n6.

A polecat with agent_state=running\nor hook_bead assigned but NO tmux session is a zombie that will sit forever\nundetected unless you proactively check.\n\nFor EVERY polecat with agent_state=running/working OR hook_bead assigned:\n```bash\ngt session status \u003crig\u003e/\u003cname\u003e --json | jq -r '.running' | grep -q true \u0026\u0026 echo ALIVE || echo ZOMBIE\n```\n\n**If ZOMBIE detected** (session missing, agent says working):\n\n1.

Check if it's safe to nuke:\n\n```bash\n# Check git status in the polecat's worktree\ncd polecats/\u003cname\u003e\ngit status --porcelain         # Should be empty (clean)\ngit log @{u}..HEAD      # Should have no unpushed commits\n```\n\n**If clean** (no uncommitted changes, no unpushed commits):\n```bash\n# Safe to nuke - no work to lose\ngt polecat nuke \u003cname\u003e\n```\nLog the auto-nuke for audit purposes. No escalation needed.\n\n**If dirty** (uncommitted or unpushed work):\n```bash\n# Escalate to Deacon - polecat has work that might be valuable\ngt mail send deacon/ -s \\\"IDLE_DIRTY: \u003cpolecat\u003e has uncommitted work\\\" \\\n  -m \\\"Polecat: \u003cname\u003e\nState: idle (no hook_bead)\nGit status: \u003cuncommitted-files\u003e\nUnpushed commits: \u003ccount\u003e\n\nPlease advise: recover work or discard?\\\"\n```\n\n**Rationale**: Idle polecats with clean git state are pure overhead. They have\nno work and no state worth preserving. Nuking them immediately frees resources\nand reduces noise. Only escalate when there's actual work at risk.\n\n**Step 4: Decide action**\n\n| Observation | Action |\n|-------------|--------|\n| agent_state=running, session alive, recent activity | None |\n| agent_state=running, session alive, idle 5-15 min | Gentle nudge |\n| agent_state=running, session alive, idle 15+ min | Direct nudge with deadline |\n| agent_state=running, SESSION DEAD | ZOMBIE — handle in Step 2a |\n| agent_state=stuck | Assess and help or escalate |\n| agent_state=done | Verify cleanup triggered (see Step 4a) |\n\n**Step 4a: Handle agent_state=done**\n\nIn the ephemeral model, polecats with agent_state=done and cleanup_status=clean\nshould already be nuked by HandlePolecatDone. Finding one here indicates:\n\n1. **Stale agent bead** - polecat was nuked but bead remains\n   ```bash\n   # Verify polecat doesn't exist anymore\n   ls polecats/\u003cname\u003e 2\u003e/dev/null || echo \"Already nuked\"\n   ```\n   If nuked, the agent bead is stale. Clean it up or ignore.\n\n2. **Cleanup wisp exists** - polecat has dirty state needing intervention\n   ```bash\n   bd list --label polecat:\u003cname\u003e --status=open\n   ```\n   Process in process-cleanups step.\n\n3. **No wisp, polecat exists** - POLECAT_DONE mail was missed\n   Try auto-nuke directly (ephemeral model):\n   ```bash\n   # Check cleanup_status and nuke if clean\n   gt polecat nuke \u003cname\u003e  # Will fail if dirty\n   ```\n   If nuke fails (dirty state), create cleanup wisp for investigation.\n\n**Step 5: Execute nudges**\n```bash\n# Use --mode=queue to avoid interrupting in-flight tool calls\ngt nudge --mode=queue \u003crig\u003e/polecats/\u003cname\u003e \"How's progress? Need help?\"\n```\n\n**Step 6: Escalate if needed**\n```bash\ngt mail send deacon/ -s \"Escalation: \u003cpolecat\u003e stuck\" \\\n  -m \"Polecat \u003cname\u003e reports stuck. Please intervene.\"\n```\n\n**Parallelism**: Use Task tool subagents to inspect multiple polecats concurrently.\n\n**ZFC Principle**: Trust agent_state from beads for WHAT agents report. But\nverify tmux session existence for WHETHER agents are alive. A dead session with\nagent_state=running is a zombie — the agent cannot correct its own state.\n\n**Step 7: ORPHANED BEAD DETECTION — Scan from beads side**\n\n🚨 **CRITICAL**: Zombie detection (Step 2a) scans FROM polecat directories.\nOnce a polecat is nuked and its directory removed, its beads become invisible\nto zombie detection. Orphaned bead detection scans FROM beads to catch this case.\n\n```bash\nbd list --status=in_progress --json --limit=0\nbd list --status=hooked --json --limit=0\n```\n\nFor each in_progress or hooked bead with a polecat assignee (format: `\u003crig\u003e/polecats/\u003cname\u003e`):\n1. Only check beads assigned to polecats in YOUR rig\n2. Check tmux session: `gt session status \u003crig\u003e/\u003cname\u003e --json | jq -r '.running'`\n3. Check polecat directory: `ls \u003crig\u003e/polecats/\u003cname\u003e 2\u003e/dev/null`\n4. If BOTH session dead AND directory missing → orphan. Reset the bead:\n   ```bash\n   bd update \u003cbead-id\u003e --status=open --assignee=\n   gt mail send deacon/ -s \"ORPHAN_RECOVERED: \u003cbead-id\u003e\" \\\n     -m \"Bead \u003cbead-id\u003e was assigned to \u003crig\u003e/polecats/\u003cname\u003e which no longer exists.\n   The bead has been reset to open with no assignee.\n   Please re-dispatch to an available polecat.\"\n   ```\n5.

A polecat with agent_state=running\nor hook_bead assigned but NO tmux session is a zombie that will sit forever\nundetected unless you proactively check.\n\nFor EVERY polecat with agent_state=running/working OR hook_bead assigned:\n```bash\ngt session status \u003crig\u003e/\u003cname\u003e --json | jq -r '.running' | grep -q true \u0026\u0026 echo ALIVE || echo ZOMBIE\n```\n\n**If ZOMBIE detected** (session missing, agent says working):\n\n1.

Check if it's safe to nuke:\n\n```bash\n# Check git status in the polecat's worktree\ncd polecats/\u003cname\u003e\ngit status --porcelain         # Should be empty (clean)\ngit log @{u}..HEAD      # Should have no unpushed commits\n```\n\n**If clean** (no uncommitted changes, no unpushed commits):\n```bash\n# Safe to nuke - no work to lose\ngt polecat nuke \u003cname\u003e\n```\nLog the auto-nuke for audit purposes. No escalation needed.\n\n**If dirty** (uncommitted or unpushed work):\n```bash\n# Escalate to Deacon - polecat has work that might be valuable\ngt mail send deacon/ -s \\\"IDLE_DIRTY: \u003cpolecat\u003e has uncommitted work\\\" \\\n  -m \\\"Polecat: \u003cname\u003e\nState: idle (no hook_bead)\nGit status: \u003cuncommitted-files\u003e\nUnpushed commits: \u003ccount\u003e\n\nPlease advise: recover work or discard?\\\"\n```\n\n**Rationale**: Idle polecats with clean git state are pure overhead. They have\nno work and no state worth preserving. Nuking them immediately frees resources\nand reduces noise. Only escalate when there's actual work at risk.\n\n**Step 4: Decide action**\n\n| Observation | Action |\n|-------------|--------|\n| agent_state=running, session alive, recent activity | None |\n| agent_state=running, session alive, idle 5-15 min | Gentle nudge |\n| agent_state=running, session alive, idle 15+ min | Direct nudge with deadline |\n| agent_state=running, SESSION DEAD | ZOMBIE — handle in Step 2a |\n| agent_state=stuck | Assess and help or escalate |\n| agent_state=done | Verify cleanup triggered (see Step 4a) |\n\n**Step 4a: Handle agent_state=done**\n\nIn the ephemeral model, polecats with agent_state=done and cleanup_status=clean\nshould already be nuked by HandlePolecatDone. Finding one here indicates:\n\n1. **Stale agent bead** - polecat was nuked but bead remains\n   ```bash\n   # Verify polecat doesn't exist anymore\n   ls polecats/\u003cname\u003e 2\u003e/dev/null || echo \"Already nuked\"\n   ```\n   If nuked, the agent bead is stale. Clean it up or ignore.\n\n2. **Cleanup wisp exists** - polecat has dirty state needing intervention\n   ```bash\n   bd list --label polecat:\u003cname\u003e --status=open\n   ```\n   Process in process-cleanups step.\n\n3. **No wisp, polecat exists** - POLECAT_DONE mail was missed\n   Try auto-nuke directly (ephemeral model):\n   ```bash\n   # Check cleanup_status and nuke if clean\n   gt polecat nuke \u003cname\u003e  # Will fail if dirty\n   ```\n   If nuke fails (dirty state), create cleanup wisp for investigation.\n\n**Step 5: Execute nudges**\n```bash\n# Use --mode=queue to avoid interrupting in-flight tool calls\ngt nudge --mode=queue \u003crig\u003e/polecats/\u003cname\u003e \"How's progress? Need help?\"\n```\n\n**Step 6: Escalate if needed**\n```bash\ngt mail send deacon/ -s \"Escalation: \u003cpolecat\u003e stuck\" \\\n  -m \"Polecat \u003cname\u003e reports stuck. Please intervene.\"\n```\n\n**Parallelism**: Use Task tool subagents to inspect multiple polecats concurrently.\n\n**ZFC Principle**: Trust agent_state from beads for WHAT agents report. But\nverify tmux session existence for WHETHER agents are alive. A dead session with\nagent_state=running is a zombie — the agent cannot correct its own state.\n\n**Step 7: ORPHANED BEAD DETECTION — Scan from beads side**\n\n🚨 **CRITICAL**: Zombie detection (Step 2a) scans FROM polecat directories.\nOnce a polecat is nuked and its directory removed, its beads become invisible\nto zombie detection. Orphaned bead detection scans FROM beads to catch this case.\n\n```bash\nbd list --status=in_progress --json --limit=0\nbd list --status=hooked --json --limit=0\n```\n\nFor each in_progress or hooked bead with a polecat assignee (format: `\u003crig\u003e/polecats/\u003cname\u003e`):\n1. Only check beads assigned to polecats in YOUR rig\n2. Check tmux session: `gt session status \u003crig\u003e/\u003cname\u003e --json | jq -r '.running'`\n3. Check polecat directory: `ls \u003crig\u003e/polecats/\u003cname\u003e 2\u003e/dev/null`\n4. If BOTH session dead AND directory missing → orphan. Reset the bead:\n   ```bash\n   bd update \u003cbead-id\u003e --status=open --assignee=\n   gt mail send deacon/ -s \"ORPHAN_RECOVERED: \u003cbead-id\u003e\" \\\n     -m \"Bead \u003cbead-id\u003e was assigned to \u003crig\u003e/polecats/\u003cname\u003e which no longer exists.\n   The bead has been reset to open with no assignee.\n   Please re-dispatch to an available polecat.\"\n   ```\n5. If directory exists but session dead → skip (zombie detection handles it)\n6. If session alive → not an orphan, skip","design":"","due_at":null,"ephemeral":0,"estimated_minutes":null,"event_kind":"","external_ref":null,"hook_bead":"","id":"gt-mol-zf1qw","is_template":0,"issue_type":"task","last_activity":null,"metadata":"{}","mol_type":"","notes":"","original_size":null,"owner":"","payload":"","pinned":0,"priority":2,"quality_score":null,"rig":"","role_bead":"","role_type":"","sender":"","source_repo":"","source_system":"","spec_id":"","status":"closed","target":"","timeout_ns":0,"title":"Inspect all active polecats","updated_at":"2026-02-22T19:23:10Z","waiters":"","wisp_type":"","work_type":""}

Its sandbox is\npreserved for reuse by future slings (persistent polecat model, gt-4ac).\n\n⚠️ **Do NOT nuke idle polecats.** Their sandbox is preserved for reuse.\nNuking would force a full re-clone on the next sling, which is slow.\n\nCheck for pending MRs — an idle polecat may have work in the refinery:\n```bash\n# Check for cleanup wisps (merge-requested = MR pending in refinery)\nbd list --label polecat:\u003cname\u003e,state:merge-requested --status=open\n```\nIf a merge-requested wisp exists, the polecat's MR is in the refinery queue.\nDo NOT nuke — the refinery needs the remote branch.\n\n**If dirty** (uncommitted or unpushed work):\n```bash\n# Escalate to Deacon - polecat has work that might be valuable\ngt mail send deacon/ -s \\\"IDLE_DIRTY: \u003cpolecat\u003e has uncommitted work\\\" \\\n  -m \\\"Polecat: \u003cname\u003e\nState: idle (no hook_bead)\nGit status: \u003cuncommitted-files\u003e\nUnpushed commits: \u003ccount\u003e\n\nPlease advise: recover work or discard?\\\"\n```\n\n**Rationale**: Idle polecats are preserved for reuse. Their sandbox contains\na pre-configured worktree that saves clone time on the next sling. Only\nescalate when there's actual dirty state at risk.\n\n**Step 4: Decide action**\n\n| Observation | Action |\n|-------------|--------|\n| agent_state=running, session alive, recent activity | None |\n| agent_state=running, session alive, idle 5-15 min | Gentle nudge |\n| agent_state=running, session alive, idle 15+ min | Direct nudge with deadline |\n| agent_state=running, SESSION DEAD | ZOMBIE — handle in Step 2a |\n| agent_state=stuck | Assess and help or escalate |\n| agent_state=done | Verify cleanup triggered (see Step 4a) |\n\n**Step 4a: Handle agent_state=done**\n\nIn the persistent model, polecats with agent_state=done should be idle with\ntheir sandbox preserved. Finding one here indicates:\n\n1. **Stale agent bead** - polecat was nuked but bead remains\n   ```bash\n   # Verify polecat doesn't exist anymore\n   ls polecats/\u003cname\u003e 2\u003e/dev/null || echo \"Already nuked\"\n   ```\n   If nuked, the agent bead is stale. Clean it up or ignore.\n\n2. **Cleanup wisp exists** - polecat has dirty state needing intervention\n   ```bash\n   bd list --label polecat:\u003cname\u003e --status=open\n   ```\n   Process in process-cleanups step.\n\n3. **No wisp, polecat exists** - POLECAT_DONE mail was missed\n   Check for pending MR before taking any action:\n   ```bash\n   # Check for pending MR (gt-6a9d: do NOT nuke if MR pending)\n   bd list --label polecat:\u003cname\u003e,state:merge-requested --status=open\n   # If no pending MR and no dirty state → polecat is idle, leave it\n   ```\n   If dirty state exists, create cleanup wisp for investigation.\n\n**Step 5: Execute nudges**\n```bash\n# Use --mode=queue to avoid interrupting in-flight tool calls\ngt nudge --mode=queue \u003crig\u003e/polecats/\u003cname\u003e \"How's progress? Need help?\"\n```\n\n**Step 6: Escalate if needed**\n```bash\ngt mail send deacon/ -s \"Escalation: \u003cpolecat\u003e stuck\" \\\n  -m \"Polecat \u003cname\u003e reports stuck. Please intervene.\"\n```\n\n**Parallelism**: Use Task tool subagents to inspect multiple polecats concurrently.\n\n**ZFC Principle**: Trust agent_state from beads for WHAT agents report. But\nverify tmux session existence for WHETHER agents are alive. A dead session with\nagent_state=running is a zombie — the agent cannot correct its own state.\n\n**Step 7: ORPHANED BEAD DETECTION — Scan from beads side**\n\n🚨 **CRITICAL**: Zombie detection (Step 2a) scans FROM polecat directories.\nOnce a polecat is nuked and its directory removed, its beads become invisible\nto zombie detection. Orphaned bead detection scans FROM beads to catch this case.\n\n```bash\nbd list --status=in_progress --json --limit=0\nbd list --status=hooked --json --limit=0\n```\n\nFor each in_progress or hooked bead with a polecat assignee (format: `\u003crig\u003e/polecats/\u003cname\u003e`):\n0. Verify bead status is still in_progress/hooked (not closed since listing). If\n   closed, skip — the polecat completed its work. (gt-sy8)\n1. Only check beads assigned to polecats in YOUR rig\n2. Check tmux session: `gt session status \u003crig\u003e/\u003cname\u003e --json | jq -r '.running'`\n3. Check polecat directory: `ls \u003crig\u003e/polecats/\u003cname\u003e 2\u003e/dev/null`\n4. If BOTH session dead AND directory missing → orphan. Reset the bead:\n   ```bash\n   bd update \u003cbead-id\u003e --status=open --assignee=\n   gt mail send deacon/ -s \"ORPHAN_RECOVERED: \u003cbead-id\u003e\" \\\n     -m \"Bead \u003cbead-id\u003e was assigned to \u003crig\u003e/polecats/\u003cname\u003e which no longer exists.\n   The bead has been reset to open with no assignee.\n   Please re-dispatch to an available polecat.\"\n   ```\n5.

Its sandbox is\npreserved for reuse by future slings (persistent polecat model, gt-4ac).\n\n⚠️ **Do NOT nuke idle polecats.** Their sandbox is preserved for reuse.\nNuking would force a full re-clone on the next sling, which is slow.\n\nCheck for pending MRs — an idle polecat may have work in the refinery:\n```bash\n# Check for cleanup wisps (merge-requested = MR pending in refinery)\nbd list --label polecat:\u003cname\u003e,state:merge-requested --status=open\n```\nIf a merge-requested wisp exists, the polecat's MR is in the refinery queue.\nDo NOT nuke — the refinery needs the remote branch.\n\n**If dirty** (uncommitted or unpushed work):\n```bash\n# Escalate to Deacon - polecat has work that might be valuable\ngt mail send deacon/ -s \\\"IDLE_DIRTY: \u003cpolecat\u003e has uncommitted work\\\" \\\n  -m \\\"Polecat: \u003cname\u003e\nState: idle (no hook_bead)\nGit status: \u003cuncommitted-files\u003e\nUnpushed commits: \u003ccount\u003e\n\nPlease advise: recover work or discard?\\\"\n```\n\n**Rationale**: Idle polecats are preserved for reuse. Their sandbox contains\na pre-configured worktree that saves clone time on the next sling. Only\nescalate when there's actual dirty state at risk.\n\n**Step 4: Decide action**\n\n| Observation | Action |\n|-------------|--------|\n| agent_state=running, session alive, recent activity | None |\n| agent_state=running, session alive, idle 5-15 min | Gentle nudge |\n| agent_state=running, session alive, idle 15+ min | Direct nudge with deadline |\n| agent_state=running, SESSION DEAD | ZOMBIE — handle in Step 2a |\n| agent_state=stuck | Assess and help or escalate |\n| agent_state=done | Verify cleanup triggered (see Step 4a) |\n\n**Step 4a: Handle agent_state=done**\n\nIn the persistent model, polecats with agent_state=done should be idle with\ntheir sandbox preserved. Finding one here indicates:\n\n1. **Stale agent bead** - polecat was nuked but bead remains\n   ```bash\n   # Verify polecat doesn't exist anymore\n   ls polecats/\u003cname\u003e 2\u003e/dev/null || echo \"Already nuked\"\n   ```\n   If nuked, the agent bead is stale. Clean it up or ignore.\n\n2. **Cleanup wisp exists** - polecat has dirty state needing intervention\n   ```bash\n   bd list --label polecat:\u003cname\u003e --status=open\n   ```\n   Process in process-cleanups step.\n\n3. **No wisp, polecat exists** - POLECAT_DONE mail was missed\n   Check for pending MR before taking any action:\n   ```bash\n   # Check for pending MR (gt-6a9d: do NOT nuke if MR pending)\n   bd list --label polecat:\u003cname\u003e,state:merge-requested --status=open\n   # If no pending MR and no dirty state → polecat is idle, leave it\n   ```\n   If dirty state exists, create cleanup wisp for investigation.\n\n**Step 5: Execute nudges**\n```bash\n# Use --mode=queue to avoid interrupting in-flight tool calls\ngt nudge --mode=queue \u003crig\u003e/polecats/\u003cname\u003e \"How's progress? Need help?\"\n```\n\n**Step 6: Escalate if needed**\n```bash\ngt mail send deacon/ -s \"Escalation: \u003cpolecat\u003e stuck\" \\\n  -m \"Polecat \u003cname\u003e reports stuck. Please intervene.\"\n```\n\n**Parallelism**: Use Task tool subagents to inspect multiple polecats concurrently.\n\n**ZFC Principle**: Trust agent_state from beads for WHAT agents report. But\nverify tmux session existence for WHETHER agents are alive. A dead session with\nagent_state=running is a zombie — the agent cannot correct its own state.\n\n**Step 7: ORPHANED BEAD DETECTION — Scan from beads side**\n\n🚨 **CRITICAL**: Zombie detection (Step 2a) scans FROM polecat directories.\nOnce a polecat is nuked and its directory removed, its beads become invisible\nto zombie detection. Orphaned bead detection scans FROM beads to catch this case.\n\n```bash\nbd list --status=in_progress --json --limit=0\nbd list --status=hooked --json --limit=0\n```\n\nFor each in_progress or hooked bead with a polecat assignee (format: `\u003crig\u003e/polecats/\u003cname\u003e`):\n0. Verify bead status is still in_progress/hooked (not closed since listing). If\n   closed, skip — the polecat completed its work. (gt-sy8)\n1. Only check beads assigned to polecats in YOUR rig\n2. Check tmux session: `gt session status \u003crig\u003e/\u003cname\u003e --json | jq -r '.running'`\n3. Check polecat directory: `ls \u003crig\u003e/polecats/\u003cname\u003e 2\u003e/dev/null`\n4. If BOTH session dead AND directory missing → orphan. Reset the bead:\n   ```bash\n   bd update \u003cbead-id\u003e --status=open --assignee=\n   gt mail send deacon/ -s \"ORPHAN_RECOVERED: \u003cbead-id\u003e\" \\\n     -m \"Bead \u003cbead-id\u003e was assigned to \u003crig\u003e/polecats/\u003cname\u003e which no longer exists.\n   The bead has been reset to open with no assignee.\n   Please re-dispatch to an available polecat.\"\n   ```\n5. If directory exists but session dead → skip (zombie detection handles it)\n6.

Wisp lifecycle for non-witness wisps is the reaper Dog's job.\nIf you encounter wisps that look orphaned but weren't created by your patrol,\nreport them to Deacon — do NOT close them.

A polecat with agent_state=running\nor hook_bead assigned but NO tmux session is a zombie that will sit forever\nundetected unless you proactively check.\n\nFor EVERY polecat with agent_state=running/working OR hook_bead assigned:\n```bash\ngt session status \u003crig\u003e/\u003cname\u003e --json | jq -r '.running' | grep -q true \u0026\u0026 echo ALIVE || echo ZOMBIE\n```\n\n**If ZOMBIE detected** (session missing, agent says working):\n\n**IMPORTANT (gt-sy8)**: Before processing as zombie, check if the hook_bead is\nalready CLOSED:\n```bash\nbd show \u003chook_bead\u003e --json | jq -r '.[0].status'\n```\nIf status is \"closed\", the polecat completed its work successfully. The dead\nsession is expected (gt done kills it). Just nuke the dead session — do NOT\ntrigger re-dispatch or send RECOVERED_BEAD/RECOVERY_NEEDED to Deacon.\n\n1. Check git state to determine if work is recoverable:\n```bash\ncd polecats/\u003cname\u003e/\u003crig\u003e\ngit status --porcelain         # Uncommitted changes?\ngit log @{u}..HEAD      # Unpushed commits?\n```\n\n2. **If clean** (no uncommitted, no unpushed): Check for pending MR first.\n```bash\n# CRITICAL (gt-6a9d): Check for pending MR before any nuke!\nbd list --label polecat:\u003cname\u003e,state:merge-requested --status=open\n# If merge-requested wisp exists → DO NOT NUKE, MR pending in refinery\n# If no pending MR → safe to nuke (zombie with no work to preserve)\ngt polecat nuke \u003cname\u003e\n```\n\n3. **If dirty** (has unpushed/uncommitted work): Escalate to Deacon for recovery.\n```bash\ngt mail send deacon/ -s \"RECOVERY_NEEDED \u003crig\u003e/\u003cname\u003e\" \\\n  -m \"Polecat: \u003crig\u003e/\u003cname\u003e\nCleanup Status: \u003chas_uncommitted|has_unpushed|has_stash\u003e\nHook Bead: \u003chook_bead\u003e\nDetected: $(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)\n\nZombie detected: tmux session dead, agent_state=\u003cstate\u003e.\nThis polecat has unpushed/uncommitted work that will be lost if nuked.\nPlease coordinate recovery before authorizing cleanup.\"\n```\n\nAlso create a cleanup wisp for tracking:\n```bash\nbd create --ephemeral --title \"cleanup:\u003cname\u003e\" \\\n  --description \"Zombie detected: session dead, state=\u003cagent_state\u003e\" \\\n  --labels cleanup,polecat:\u003cname\u003e,state:zombie-detected\n```\n\n**Step 3: For running polecats (with LIVE session), assess progress**\n\nCheck the hook_bead field to see what they're working on:\n```bash\nbd show \u003chook_bead\u003e  # See current step/issue\n```\n\nYou can also verify they're responsive:\n```bash\ngt peek \u003crig\u003e/\u003cname\u003e 20\n```\n\nLook for:\n- Recent tool activity → making progress\n- Idle at prompt → may need nudge\n- Error messages → may need help\n\n**Step 3a: For idle polecats, verify sandbox health**\n\nWhen agent_state=idle, the polecat has no work assigned. Its sandbox is\npreserved for reuse by future slings (persistent polecat model, gt-4ac).\n\n⚠️ **Do NOT nuke idle polecats.** Their sandbox is preserved for reuse.\nNuking would force a full re-clone on the next sling, which is slow.\n\nCheck for pending MRs — an idle polecat may have work in the refinery:\n```bash\n# Check for cleanup wisps (merge-requested = MR pending in refinery)\nbd list --label polecat:\u003cname\u003e,state:merge-requested --status=open\n```\nIf a merge-requested wisp exists, the polecat's MR is in the refinery queue.\nDo NOT nuke — the refinery needs the remote branch.\n\n**If dirty** (uncommitted or unpushed work):\n```bash\n# Escalate to Deacon - polecat has work that might be valuable\ngt mail send deacon/ -s \\\"IDLE_DIRTY: \u003cpolecat\u003e has uncommitted work\\\" \\\n  -m \\\"Polecat: \u003cname\u003e\nState: idle (no hook_bead)\nGit status: \u003cuncommitted-files\u003e\nUnpushed commits: \u003ccount\u003e\n\nPlease advise: recover work or discard?\\\"\n```\n\n**Rationale**: Idle polecats are preserved for reuse. Their sandbox contains\na pre-configured worktree that saves clone time on the next sling. Only\nescalate when there's actual dirty state at risk.\n\n**Step 4: Decide action**\n\n| Observation | Action |\n|-------------|--------|\n| agent_state=running, session alive, recent activity | None |\n| agent_state=running, session alive, idle 5-15 min | Gentle nudge |\n| agent_state=running, session alive, idle 15+ min | Direct nudge with deadline |\n| agent_state=running, SESSION DEAD | ZOMBIE — handle in Step 2a |\n| agent_state=stuck | Assess and help or escalate |\n| agent_state=done | Verify cleanup triggered (see Step 4a) |\n\n**Step 4a: Handle agent_state=done**\n\nIn the persistent model, polecats with agent_state=done should be idle with\ntheir sandbox preserved. Finding one here indicates:\n\n1. **Stale agent bead** - polecat was nuked but bead remains\n   ```bash\n   # Verify polecat doesn't exist anymore\n   ls polecats/\u003cname\u003e 2\u003e/dev/null || echo \"Already nuked\"\n   ```\n   If nuked, the agent bead is stale. Clean it up or ignore.\n\n2. **Cleanup wisp exists** - polecat has dirty state needing intervention\n   ```bash\n   bd list --label polecat:\u003cname\u003e --status=open\n   ```\n   Process in process-cleanups step.\n\n3. **No wisp, polecat exists** - POLECAT_DONE mail was missed\n   Check for pending MR before taking any action:\n   ```bash\n   # Check for pending MR (gt-6a9d: do NOT nuke if MR pending)\n   bd list --label polecat:\u003cname\u003e,state:merge-requested --status=open\n   # If no pending MR and no dirty state → polecat is idle, leave it\n   ```\n   If dirty state exists, create cleanup wisp for investigation.\n\n**Step 5: Execute nudges**\n```bash\n# Use --mode=queue to avoid interrupting in-flight tool calls\ngt nudge --mode=queue \u003crig\u003e/polecats/\u003cname\u003e \"How's progress? Need help?\"\n```\n\n**Step 6: Escalate if needed**\n```bash\ngt mail send deacon/ -s \"Escalation: \u003cpolecat\u003e stuck\" \\\n  -m \"Polecat \u003cname\u003e reports stuck. Please intervene.\"\n```\n\n**Parallelism**: Use Task tool subagents to inspect multiple polecats concurrently.\n\n**ZFC Principle**: Trust agent_state from beads for WHAT agents report. But\nverify tmux session existence for WHETHER agents are alive. A dead session with\nagent_state=running is a zombie — the agent cannot correct its own state.\n\n**Step 7: ORPHANED BEAD DETECTION — Scan from beads side**\n\n🚨 **CRITICAL**: Zombie detection (Step 2a) scans FROM polecat directories.\nOnce a polecat is nuked and its directory removed, its beads become invisible\nto zombie detection. Orphaned bead detection scans FROM beads to catch this case.\n\n```bash\nbd list --status=in_progress --json --limit=0\nbd list --status=hooked --json --limit=0\n```\n\nFor each in_progress or hooked bead with a polecat assignee (format: `\u003crig\u003e/polecats/\u003cname\u003e`):\n0. Verify bead status is still in_progress/hooked (not closed since listing). If\n   closed, skip — the polecat completed its work. (gt-sy8)\n1. Only check beads assigned to polecats in YOUR rig\n2. Check tmux session: `gt session status \u003crig\u003e/\u003cname\u003e --json | jq -r '.running'`\n3. Check polecat directory: `ls \u003crig\u003e/polecats/\u003cname\u003e 2\u003e/dev/null`\n4. If BOTH session dead AND directory missing → orphan. Reset the bead:\n   ```bash\n   bd update \u003cbead-id\u003e --status=open --assignee=\n   gt mail send deacon/ -s \"ORPHAN_RECOVERED: \u003cbead-id\u003e\" \\\n     -m \"Bead \u003cbead-id\u003e was assigned to \u003crig\u003e/polecats/\u003cname\u003e which no longer exists.\n   The bead has been reset to open with no assignee.\n   Please re-dispatch to an available polecat.\"\n   ```\n5. If directory exists but session dead → skip (zombie detection handles it)\n6.

Its sandbox is\npreserved for reuse by future slings (persistent polecat model, gt-4ac).\n\n⚠️ **Do NOT nuke idle polecats.** Their sandbox is preserved for reuse.\nNuking would force a full re-clone on the next sling, which is slow.\n\nCheck for pending MRs — an idle polecat may have work in the refinery:\n```bash\n# Check for cleanup wisps (merge-requested = MR pending in refinery)\nbd list --label polecat:\u003cname\u003e,state:merge-requested --status=open\n```\nIf a merge-requested wisp exists, the polecat's MR is in the refinery queue.\nDo NOT nuke — the refinery needs the remote branch.\n\n**If dirty** (uncommitted or unpushed work):\n```bash\n# Escalate to Deacon - polecat has work that might be valuable\ngt mail send deacon/ -s \\\"IDLE_DIRTY: \u003cpolecat\u003e has uncommitted work\\\" \\\n  -m \\\"Polecat: \u003cname\u003e\nState: idle (no hook_bead)\nGit status: \u003cuncommitted-files\u003e\nUnpushed commits: \u003ccount\u003e\n\nPlease advise: recover work or discard?\\\"\n```\n\n**Rationale**: Idle polecats are preserved for reuse. Their sandbox contains\na pre-configured worktree that saves clone time on the next sling. Only\nescalate when there's actual dirty state at risk.\n\n**Step 4: Decide action**\n\n| Observation | Action |\n|-------------|--------|\n| agent_state=running, session alive, recent activity | None |\n| agent_state=running, session alive, idle 5-15 min | Gentle nudge |\n| agent_state=running, session alive, idle 15+ min | Direct nudge with deadline |\n| agent_state=running, SESSION DEAD | ZOMBIE — handle in Step 2a |\n| agent_state=stuck | Assess and help or escalate |\n| agent_state=done | Verify cleanup triggered (see Step 4a) |\n\n**Step 4a: Handle agent_state=done**\n\nIn the persistent model, polecats with agent_state=done should be idle with\ntheir sandbox preserved. Finding one here indicates:\n\n1. **Stale agent bead** - polecat was nuked but bead remains\n   ```bash\n   # Verify polecat doesn't exist anymore\n   ls polecats/\u003cname\u003e 2\u003e/dev/null || echo \"Already nuked\"\n   ```\n   If nuked, the agent bead is stale. Clean it up or ignore.\n\n2. **Cleanup wisp exists** - polecat has dirty state needing intervention\n   ```bash\n   bd list --label polecat:\u003cname\u003e --status=open\n   ```\n   Process in process-cleanups step.\n\n3. **No wisp, polecat exists** - POLECAT_DONE mail was missed\n   Check for pending MR before taking any action:\n   ```bash\n   # Check for pending MR (gt-6a9d: do NOT nuke if MR pending)\n   bd list --label polecat:\u003cname\u003e,state:merge-requested --status=open\n   # If no pending MR and no dirty state → polecat is idle, leave it\n   ```\n   If dirty state exists, create cleanup wisp for investigation.\n\n**Step 5: Execute nudges**\n```bash\n# Use --mode=queue to avoid interrupting in-flight tool calls\ngt nudge --mode=queue \u003crig\u003e/polecats/\u003cname\u003e \"How's progress? Need help?\"\n```\n\n**Step 6: Escalate if needed**\n```bash\ngt mail send deacon/ -s \"Escalation: \u003cpolecat\u003e stuck\" \\\n  -m \"Polecat \u003cname\u003e reports stuck. Please intervene.\"\n```\n\n**Parallelism**: Use Task tool subagents to inspect multiple polecats concurrently.\n\n**ZFC Principle**: Trust agent_state from beads for WHAT agents report. But\nverify tmux session existence for WHETHER agents are alive. A dead session with\nagent_state=running is a zombie — the agent cannot correct its own state.\n\n**Step 7: ORPHANED BEAD DETECTION — Scan from beads side**\n\n🚨 **CRITICAL**: Zombie detection (Step 2a) scans FROM polecat directories.\nOnce a polecat is nuked and its directory removed, its beads become invisible\nto zombie detection. Orphaned bead detection scans FROM beads to catch this case.\n\n```bash\nbd list --status=in_progress --json --limit=0\nbd list --status=hooked --json --limit=0\n```\n\nFor each in_progress or hooked bead with a polecat assignee (format: `\u003crig\u003e/polecats/\u003cname\u003e`):\n0. Verify bead status is still in_progress/hooked (not closed since listing). If\n   closed, skip — the polecat completed its work. (gt-sy8)\n1. Only check beads assigned to polecats in YOUR rig\n2. Check tmux session: `gt session status \u003crig\u003e/\u003cname\u003e --json | jq -r '.running'`\n3. Check polecat directory: `ls \u003crig\u003e/polecats/\u003cname\u003e 2\u003e/dev/null`\n4. If BOTH session dead AND directory missing → orphan. Reset the bead:\n   ```bash\n   bd update \u003cbead-id\u003e --status=open --assignee=\n   gt mail send deacon/ -s \"ORPHAN_RECOVERED: \u003cbead-id\u003e\" \\\n     -m \"Bead \u003cbead-id\u003e was assigned to \u003crig\u003e/polecats/\u003cname\u003e which no longer exists.\n   The bead has been reset to open with no assignee.\n   Please re-dispatch to an available polecat.\"\n   ```\n5. If directory exists but session dead → skip (zombie detection handles it)\n6.

Check git state to determine if work is recoverable:\n```bash\ncd polecats/\u003cname\u003e/\u003crig\u003e\ngit status --porcelain         # Uncommitted changes?\ngit log @{u}..HEAD      # Unpushed commits?\n```\n\n2. **If clean** (no uncommitted, no unpushed): Check for pending MR first.\n```bash\n# CRITICAL (gt-6a9d): Check for pending MR before any nuke!\nbd list --label polecat:\u003cname\u003e,state:merge-requested --status=open\n# If merge-requested wisp exists → DO NOT NUKE, MR pending in refinery\n# If no pending MR → safe to nuke (zombie with no work to preserve)\ngt polecat nuke \u003cname\u003e\n```\n\n3. **If dirty** (has unpushed/uncommitted work): Escalate to Deacon for recovery.\n```bash\ngt mail send deacon/ -s \"RECOVERY_NEEDED \u003crig\u003e/\u003cname\u003e\" \\\n  -m \"Polecat: \u003crig\u003e/\u003cname\u003e\nCleanup Status: \u003chas_uncommitted|has_unpushed|has_stash\u003e\nHook Bead: \u003chook_bead\u003e\nDetected: $(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)\n\nZombie detected: tmux session dead, agent_state=\u003cstate\u003e.\nThis polecat has unpushed/uncommitted work that will be lost if nuked.\nPlease coordinate recovery before authorizing cleanup.\"\n```\n\nAlso create a cleanup wisp for tracking:\n```bash\nbd create --ephemeral --title \"cleanup:\u003cname\u003e\" \\\n  --description \"Zombie detected: session dead, state=\u003cagent_state\u003e\" \\\n  --labels cleanup,polecat:\u003cname\u003e,state:zombie-detected\n```\n\n**Step 3: For running polecats (with LIVE session), assess progress**\n\nCheck the hook_bead field to see what they're working on:\n```bash\nbd show \u003chook_bead\u003e  # See current step/issue\n```\n\nYou can also verify they're responsive:\n```bash\ngt peek \u003crig\u003e/\u003cname\u003e 20\n```\n\nLook for:\n- Recent tool activity → making progress\n- Idle at prompt → may need nudge\n- Error messages → may need help\n\n**Step 3a: For idle polecats, verify sandbox health**\n\nWhen agent_state=idle, the polecat has no work assigned. Its sandbox is\npreserved for reuse by future slings (persistent polecat model, gt-4ac).\n\n⚠️ **Do NOT nuke idle polecats.** Their sandbox is preserved for reuse.\nNuking would force a full re-clone on the next sling, which is slow.\n\nCheck for pending MRs — an idle polecat may have work in the refinery:\n```bash\n# Check for cleanup wisps (merge-requested = MR pending in refinery)\nbd list --label polecat:\u003cname\u003e,state:merge-requested --status=open\n```\nIf a merge-requested wisp exists, the polecat's MR is in the refinery queue.\nDo NOT nuke — the refinery needs the remote branch.\n\n**If dirty** (uncommitted or unpushed work):\n```bash\n# Escalate to Deacon - polecat has work that might be valuable\ngt mail send deacon/ -s \\\"IDLE_DIRTY: \u003cpolecat\u003e has uncommitted work\\\" \\\n  -m \\\"Polecat: \u003cname\u003e\nState: idle (no hook_bead)\nGit status: \u003cuncommitted-files\u003e\nUnpushed commits: \u003ccount\u003e\n\nPlease advise: recover work or discard?\\\"\n```\n\n**Rationale**: Idle polecats are preserved for reuse. Their sandbox contains\na pre-configured worktree that saves clone time on the next sling. Only\nescalate when there's actual dirty state at risk.\n\n**Step 4: Decide action**\n\n| Observation | Action |\n|-------------|--------|\n| agent_state=running, session alive, recent activity | None |\n| agent_state=running, session alive, idle 5-15 min | Gentle nudge |\n| agent_state=running, session alive, idle 15+ min | Direct nudge with deadline |\n| agent_state=running, SESSION DEAD | ZOMBIE — handle in Step 2a |\n| agent_state=stuck | Assess and help or escalate |\n| agent_state=done | Verify cleanup triggered (see Step 4a) |\n\n**Step 4a: Handle agent_state=done**\n\nIn the persistent model, polecats with agent_state=done should be idle with\ntheir sandbox preserved. Finding one here indicates:\n\n1. **Stale agent bead** - polecat was nuked but bead remains\n   ```bash\n   # Verify polecat doesn't exist anymore\n   ls polecats/\u003cname\u003e 2\u003e/dev/null || echo \"Already nuked\"\n   ```\n   If nuked, the agent bead is stale. Clean it up or ignore.\n\n2. **Cleanup wisp exists** - polecat has dirty state needing intervention\n   ```bash\n   bd list --label polecat:\u003cname\u003e --status=open\n   ```\n   Process in process-cleanups step.\n\n3. **No wisp, polecat exists** - POLECAT_DONE mail was missed\n   Check for pending MR before taking any action:\n   ```bash\n   # Check for pending MR (gt-6a9d: do NOT nuke if MR pending)\n   bd list --label polecat:\u003cname\u003e,state:merge-requested --status=open\n   # If no pending MR and no dirty state → polecat is idle, leave it\n   ```\n   If dirty state exists, create cleanup wisp for investigation.\n\n**Step 5: Execute nudges**\n```bash\n# Use --mode=queue to avoid interrupting in-flight tool calls\ngt nudge --mode=queue \u003crig\u003e/polecats/\u003cname\u003e \"How's progress? Need help?\"\n```\n\n**Step 6: Escalate if needed**\n```bash\ngt mail send deacon/ -s \"Escalation: \u003cpolecat\u003e stuck\" \\\n  -m \"Polecat \u003cname\u003e reports stuck. Please intervene.\"\n```\n\n**Parallelism**: Use Task tool subagents to inspect multiple polecats concurrently.\n\n**ZFC Principle**: Trust agent_state from beads for WHAT agents report. But\nverify tmux session existence for WHETHER agents are alive. A dead session with\nagent_state=running is a zombie — the agent cannot correct its own state.\n\n**Step 7: ORPHANED BEAD DETECTION — Scan from beads side**\n\n🚨 **CRITICAL**: Zombie detection (Step 2a) scans FROM polecat directories.\nOnce a polecat is nuked and its directory removed, its beads become invisible\nto zombie detection. Orphaned bead detection scans FROM beads to catch this case.\n\n```bash\nbd list --status=in_progress --json --limit=0\nbd list --status=hooked --json --limit=0\n```\n\nFor each in_progress or hooked bead with a polecat assignee (format: `\u003crig\u003e/polecats/\u003cname\u003e`):\n0. Verify bead status is still in_progress/hooked (not closed since listing). If\n   closed, skip — the polecat completed its work. (gt-sy8)\n1. Only check beads assigned to polecats in YOUR rig\n2. Check tmux session: `gt session status \u003crig\u003e/\u003cname\u003e --json | jq -r '.running'`\n3. Check polecat directory: `ls \u003crig\u003e/polecats/\u003cname\u003e 2\u003e/dev/null`\n4. If BOTH session dead AND directory missing → orphan. Reset the bead:\n   ```bash\n   bd update \u003cbead-id\u003e --status=open --assignee=\n   gt mail send deacon/ -s \"ORPHAN_RECOVERED: \u003cbead-id\u003e\" \\\n     -m \"Bead \u003cbead-id\u003e was assigned to \u003crig\u003e/polecats/\u003cname\u003e which no longer exists.\n   The bead has been reset to open with no assignee.\n   Please re-dispatch to an available polecat.\"\n   ```\n5. If directory exists but session dead → skip (zombie detection handles it)\n6.

Check git state to determine if work is recoverable:\n```bash\ncd polecats/\u003cname\u003e/\u003crig\u003e\ngit status --porcelain         # Uncommitted changes?\ngit log @{u}..HEAD      # Unpushed commits?\n```\n\n2. **If clean** (no uncommitted, no unpushed): Check for pending MR first.\n```bash\n# CRITICAL (gt-6a9d): Check for pending MR before any nuke!\nbd list --label polecat:\u003cname\u003e,state:merge-requested --status=open\n# If merge-requested wisp exists → DO NOT NUKE, MR pending in refinery\n# If no pending MR → safe to nuke (zombie with no work to preserve)\ngt polecat nuke \u003cname\u003e\n```\n\n3. **If dirty** (has unpushed/uncommitted work): Escalate to Deacon for recovery.\n```bash\ngt mail send deacon/ -s \"RECOVERY_NEEDED \u003crig\u003e/\u003cname\u003e\" \\\n  -m \"Polecat: \u003crig\u003e/\u003cname\u003e\nCleanup Status: \u003chas_uncommitted|has_unpushed|has_stash\u003e\nHook Bead: \u003chook_bead\u003e\nDetected: $(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)\n\nZombie detected: tmux session dead, agent_state=\u003cstate\u003e.\nThis polecat has unpushed/uncommitted work that will be lost if nuked.\nPlease coordinate recovery before authorizing cleanup.\"\n```\n\nAlso create a cleanup wisp for tracking:\n```bash\nbd create --ephemeral --title \"cleanup:\u003cname\u003e\" \\\n  --description \"Zombie detected: session dead, state=\u003cagent_state\u003e\" \\\n  --labels cleanup,polecat:\u003cname\u003e,state:zombie-detected\n```\n\n**Step 3: For running polecats (with LIVE session), assess progress**\n\nCheck the hook_bead field to see what they're working on:\n```bash\nbd show \u003chook_bead\u003e  # See current step/issue\n```\n\nYou can also verify they're responsive:\n```bash\ngt peek \u003crig\u003e/\u003cname\u003e 20\n```\n\nLook for:\n- Recent tool activity → making progress\n- Idle at prompt → may need nudge\n- Error messages → may need help\n\n**Step 3a: For idle polecats, verify sandbox health**\n\nWhen agent_state=idle, the polecat has no work assigned. Its sandbox is\npreserved for reuse by future slings (persistent polecat model, gt-4ac).\n\n⚠️ **Do NOT nuke idle polecats.** Their sandbox is preserved for reuse.\nNuking would force a full re-clone on the next sling, which is slow.\n\nCheck for pending MRs — an idle polecat may have work in the refinery:\n```bash\n# Check for cleanup wisps (merge-requested = MR pending in refinery)\nbd list --label polecat:\u003cname\u003e,state:merge-requested --status=open\n```\nIf a merge-requested wisp exists, the polecat's MR is in the refinery queue.\nDo NOT nuke — the refinery needs the remote branch.\n\n**If dirty** (uncommitted or unpushed work):\n```bash\n# Escalate to Deacon - polecat has work that might be valuable\ngt mail send deacon/ -s \\\"IDLE_DIRTY: \u003cpolecat\u003e has uncommitted work\\\" \\\n  -m \\\"Polecat: \u003cname\u003e\nState: idle (no hook_bead)\nGit status: \u003cuncommitted-files\u003e\nUnpushed commits: \u003ccount\u003e\n\nPlease advise: recover work or discard?\\\"\n```\n\n**Rationale**: Idle polecats are preserved for reuse. Their sandbox contains\na pre-configured worktree that saves clone time on the next sling. Only\nescalate when there's actual dirty state at risk.\n\n**Step 4: Decide action**\n\n| Observation | Action |\n|-------------|--------|\n| agent_state=running, session alive, recent activity | None |\n| agent_state=running, session alive, idle 5-15 min | Gentle nudge |\n| agent_state=running, session alive, idle 15+ min | Direct nudge with deadline |\n| agent_state=running, SESSION DEAD | ZOMBIE — handle in Step 2a |\n| agent_state=stuck | Assess and help or escalate |\n| agent_state=done | Verify cleanup triggered (see Step 4a) |\n\n**Step 4a: Handle agent_state=done**\n\nIn the persistent model, polecats with agent_state=done should be idle with\ntheir sandbox preserved. Finding one here indicates:\n\n1. **Stale agent bead** - polecat was nuked but bead remains\n   ```bash\n   # Verify polecat doesn't exist anymore\n   ls polecats/\u003cname\u003e 2\u003e/dev/null || echo \"Already nuked\"\n   ```\n   If nuked, the agent bead is stale. Clean it up or ignore.\n\n2. **Cleanup wisp exists** - polecat has dirty state needing intervention\n   ```bash\n   bd list --label polecat:\u003cname\u003e --status=open\n   ```\n   Process in process-cleanups step.\n\n3. **No wisp, polecat exists** - POLECAT_DONE mail was missed\n   Check for pending MR before taking any action:\n   ```bash\n   # Check for pending MR (gt-6a9d: do NOT nuke if MR pending)\n   bd list --label polecat:\u003cname\u003e,state:merge-requested --status=open\n   # If no pending MR and no dirty state → polecat is idle, leave it\n   ```\n   If dirty state exists, create cleanup wisp for investigation.\n\n**Step 5: Execute nudges**\n```bash\n# Use --mode=queue to avoid interrupting in-flight tool calls\ngt nudge --mode=queue \u003crig\u003e/polecats/\u003cname\u003e \"How's progress? Need help?\"\n```\n\n**Step 6: Escalate if needed**\n```bash\ngt mail send deacon/ -s \"Escalation: \u003cpolecat\u003e stuck\" \\\n  -m \"Polecat \u003cname\u003e reports stuck. Please intervene.\"\n```\n\n**Parallelism**: Use Task tool subagents to inspect multiple polecats concurrently.\n\n**ZFC Principle**: Trust agent_state from beads for WHAT agents report. But\nverify tmux session existence for WHETHER agents are alive. A dead session with\nagent_state=running is a zombie — the agent cannot correct its own state.\n\n**Step 7: ORPHANED BEAD DETECTION — Scan from beads side**\n\n🚨 **CRITICAL**: Zombie detection (Step 2a) scans FROM polecat directories.\nOnce a polecat is nuked and its directory removed, its beads become invisible\nto zombie detection. Orphaned bead detection scans FROM beads to catch this case.\n\n```bash\nbd list --status=in_progress --json --limit=0\nbd list --status=hooked --json --limit=0\n```\n\nFor each in_progress or hooked bead with a polecat assignee (format: `\u003crig\u003e/polecats/\u003cname\u003e`):\n0. Verify bead status is still in_progress/hooked (not closed since listing). If\n   closed, skip — the polecat completed its work. (gt-sy8)\n1. Only check beads assigned to polecats in YOUR rig\n2. Check tmux session: `gt session status \u003crig\u003e/\u003cname\u003e --json | jq -r '.running'`\n3. Check polecat directory: `ls \u003crig\u003e/polecats/\u003cname\u003e 2\u003e/dev/null`\n4. If BOTH session dead AND directory missing → orphan. Reset the bead:\n   ```bash\n   bd update \u003cbead-id\u003e --status=open --assignee=\n   gt mail send deacon/ -s \"ORPHAN_RECOVERED: \u003cbead-id\u003e\" \\\n     -m \"Bead \u003cbead-id\u003e was assigned to \u003crig\u003e/polecats/\u003cname\u003e which no longer exists.\n   The bead has been reset to open with no assignee.\n   Please re-dispatch to an available polecat.\"\n   ```\n5. If directory exists but session dead → skip (zombie detection handles it)\n6.

Check git state to determine if work is recoverable:\n```bash\ncd polecats/\u003cname\u003e/\u003crig\u003e\ngit status --porcelain         # Uncommitted changes?\ngit log @{u}..HEAD      # Unpushed commits?\n```\n\n2. **If clean** (no uncommitted, no unpushed): Check for pending MR first.\n```bash\n# CRITICAL (gt-6a9d): Check for pending MR before any nuke!\nbd list --label polecat:\u003cname\u003e,state:merge-requested --status=open\n# If merge-requested wisp exists → DO NOT NUKE, MR pending in refinery\n# If no pending MR → safe to nuke (zombie with no work to preserve)\ngt polecat nuke \u003cname\u003e\n```\n\n3. **If dirty** (has unpushed/uncommitted work): Escalate to Deacon for recovery.\n```bash\ngt mail send deacon/ -s \"RECOVERY_NEEDED \u003crig\u003e/\u003cname\u003e\" \\\n  -m \"Polecat: \u003crig\u003e/\u003cname\u003e\nCleanup Status: \u003chas_uncommitted|has_unpushed|has_stash\u003e\nHook Bead: \u003chook_bead\u003e\nDetected: $(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)\n\nZombie detected: tmux session dead, agent_state=\u003cstate\u003e.\nThis polecat has unpushed/uncommitted work that will be lost if nuked.\nPlease coordinate recovery before authorizing cleanup.\"\n```\n\nAlso create a cleanup wisp for tracking:\n```bash\nbd create --ephemeral --title \"cleanup:\u003cname\u003e\" \\\n  --description \"Zombie detected: session dead, state=\u003cagent_state\u003e\" \\\n  --labels cleanup,polecat:\u003cname\u003e,state:zombie-detected\n```\n\n**Step 3: For running polecats (with LIVE session), assess progress**\n\nCheck the hook_bead field to see what they're working on:\n```bash\nbd show \u003chook_bead\u003e  # See current step/issue\n```\n\nYou can also verify they're responsive:\n```bash\ngt peek \u003crig\u003e/\u003cname\u003e 20\n```\n\nLook for:\n- Recent tool activity → making progress\n- Idle at prompt → may need nudge\n- Error messages → may need help\n\n**Step 3a: For idle polecats, verify sandbox health**\n\nWhen agent_state=idle, the polecat has no work assigned. Its sandbox is\npreserved for reuse by future slings (persistent polecat model, gt-4ac).\n\n⚠️ **Do NOT nuke idle polecats.** Their sandbox is preserved for reuse.\nNuking would force a full re-clone on the next sling, which is slow.\n\nCheck for pending MRs — an idle polecat may have work in the refinery:\n```bash\n# Check for cleanup wisps (merge-requested = MR pending in refinery)\nbd list --label polecat:\u003cname\u003e,state:merge-requested --status=open\n```\nIf a merge-requested wisp exists, the polecat's MR is in the refinery queue.\nDo NOT nuke — the refinery needs the remote branch.\n\n**If dirty** (uncommitted or unpushed work):\n```bash\n# Escalate to Deacon - polecat has work that might be valuable\ngt mail send deacon/ -s \\\"IDLE_DIRTY: \u003cpolecat\u003e has uncommitted work\\\" \\\n  -m \\\"Polecat: \u003cname\u003e\nState: idle (no hook_bead)\nGit status: \u003cuncommitted-files\u003e\nUnpushed commits: \u003ccount\u003e\n\nPlease advise: recover work or discard?\\\"\n```\n\n**Rationale**: Idle polecats are preserved for reuse. Their sandbox contains\na pre-configured worktree that saves clone time on the next sling. Only\nescalate when there's actual dirty state at risk.\n\n**Step 4: Decide action**\n\n| Observation | Action |\n|-------------|--------|\n| agent_state=running, session alive, recent activity | None |\n| agent_state=running, session alive, idle 5-15 min | Gentle nudge |\n| agent_state=running, session alive, idle 15+ min | Direct nudge with deadline |\n| agent_state=running, SESSION DEAD | ZOMBIE — handle in Step 2a |\n| agent_state=stuck | Assess and help or escalate |\n| agent_state=done | Verify cleanup triggered (see Step 4a) |\n\n**Step 4a: Handle agent_state=done**\n\nIn the persistent model, polecats with agent_state=done should be idle with\ntheir sandbox preserved. Finding one here indicates:\n\n1. **Stale agent bead** - polecat was nuked but bead remains\n   ```bash\n   # Verify polecat doesn't exist anymore\n   ls polecats/\u003cname\u003e 2\u003e/dev/null || echo \"Already nuked\"\n   ```\n   If nuked, the agent bead is stale. Clean it up or ignore.\n\n2. **Cleanup wisp exists** - polecat has dirty state needing intervention\n   ```bash\n   bd list --label polecat:\u003cname\u003e --status=open\n   ```\n   Process in process-cleanups step.\n\n3. **No wisp, polecat exists** - POLECAT_DONE mail was missed\n   Check for pending MR before taking any action:\n   ```bash\n   # Check for pending MR (gt-6a9d: do NOT nuke if MR pending)\n   bd list --label polecat:\u003cname\u003e,state:merge-requested --status=open\n   # If no pending MR and no dirty state → polecat is idle, leave it\n   ```\n   If dirty state exists, create cleanup wisp for investigation.\n\n**Step 5: Execute nudges**\n```bash\n# Use --mode=queue to avoid interrupting in-flight tool calls\ngt nudge --mode=queue \u003crig\u003e/polecats/\u003cname\u003e \"How's progress? Need help?\"\n```\n\n**Step 6: Escalate if needed**\n```bash\ngt mail send deacon/ -s \"Escalation: \u003cpolecat\u003e stuck\" \\\n  -m \"Polecat \u003cname\u003e reports stuck. Please intervene.\"\n```\n\n**Parallelism**: Use Task tool subagents to inspect multiple polecats concurrently.\n\n**ZFC Principle**: Trust agent_state from beads for WHAT agents report. But\nverify tmux session existence for WHETHER agents are alive. A dead session with\nagent_state=running is a zombie — the agent cannot correct its own state.\n\n**Step 7: ORPHANED BEAD DETECTION — Scan from beads side**\n\n🚨 **CRITICAL**: Zombie detection (Step 2a) scans FROM polecat directories.\nOnce a polecat is nuked and its directory removed, its beads become invisible\nto zombie detection. Orphaned bead detection scans FROM beads to catch this case.\n\n```bash\nbd list --status=in_progress --json --limit=0\nbd list --status=hooked --json --limit=0\n```\n\nFor each in_progress or hooked bead with a polecat assignee (format: `\u003crig\u003e/polecats/\u003cname\u003e`):\n0. Verify bead status is still in_progress/hooked (not closed since listing). If\n   closed, skip — the polecat completed its work. (gt-sy8)\n1. Only check beads assigned to polecats in YOUR rig\n2. Check tmux session: `gt session status \u003crig\u003e/\u003cname\u003e --json | jq -r '.running'`\n3. Check polecat directory: `ls \u003crig\u003e/polecats/\u003cname\u003e 2\u003e/dev/null`\n4. If BOTH session dead AND directory missing → orphan. Reset the bead:\n   ```bash\n   bd update \u003cbead-id\u003e --status=open --assignee=\n   gt mail send deacon/ -s \"ORPHAN_RECOVERED: \u003cbead-id\u003e\" \\\n     -m \"Bead \u003cbead-id\u003e was assigned to \u003crig\u003e/polecats/\u003cname\u003e which no longer exists.\n   The bead has been reset to open with no assignee.\n   Please re-dispatch to an available polecat.\"\n   ```\n5. If directory exists but session dead → skip (zombie detection handles it)\n6.

Consider waking it or escalating.\n\n**Step 3: Check deacon health**\n\n⚠️ **The deacon tmux session is named `hq-deacon`** (NOT `deacon`).\nTown-level agents use the `hq-` prefix.\n\n```bash\ntmux has-session -t hq-deacon 2\u003e/dev/null \u0026\u0026 echo \"alive\" || echo \"dead\"\n```\n\nIf the deacon session is dead, escalate to Mayor:\n```bash\ngt mail send mayor/ -s \"ALERT: Deacon session hq-deacon is down\" \\\n  -m \"Deacon tmux session (hq-deacon) not found.\nDetected during witness patrol.\nPlease restart the deacon.\"\n```\n\n**Step 4: Escalate if needed**\n\nIf you identify problems, escalate to Deacon with specific MR IDs and context:\n```bash\ngt mail send deacon/ -s \"QUEUE_HEALTH: \u003csummary\u003e\" \\\n  -m \"MR IDs: \u003cids\u003e\nObservation: \u003cwhat you found\u003e\nRecommendation: \u003cwhat should happen\u003e\"\n```","design":"","due_at":null,"ephemeral":1,"estimated_minutes":null,"event_kind":"","external_ref":null,"hook_bead":"","id":"gt-wisp-jegli","is_template":0,"issue_type":"task","last_activity":null,"metadata":"{}","mol_type":"","notes":"","original_size":null,"owner":"","payload":"","pinned":0,"priority":2,"quality_score":null,"rig":"","role_bead":"","role_type":"","sender":"","source_repo":"","source_system":"","spec_id":"","status":"open","target":"","timeout_ns":0,"title":"Check refinery and deacon health","updated_at":"2026-02-27T17:36:36Z","waiters":"","wisp_type":"","work_type":""}

Its sandbox is\npreserved for reuse by future slings (persistent polecat model, gt-4ac).\n\n⚠️ **Do NOT nuke idle polecats.** Their sandbox is preserved for reuse.\nNuking would force a full re-clone on the next sling, which is slow.\n\nCheck for pending MRs — an idle polecat may have work in the refinery:\n```bash\n# Check for cleanup wisps (merge-requested = MR pending in refinery)\nbd list --label polecat:\u003cname\u003e,state:merge-requested --status=open\n```\nIf a merge-requested wisp exists, the polecat's MR is in the refinery queue.\nDo NOT nuke — the refinery needs the remote branch.\n\n**If dirty** (uncommitted or unpushed work):\n```bash\n# Escalate to Deacon - polecat has work that might be valuable\ngt mail send deacon/ -s \\\"IDLE_DIRTY: \u003cpolecat\u003e has uncommitted work\\\" \\\n  -m \\\"Polecat: \u003cname\u003e\nState: idle (no hook_bead)\nGit status: \u003cuncommitted-files\u003e\nUnpushed commits: \u003ccount\u003e\n\nPlease advise: recover work or discard?\\\"\n```\n\n**Rationale**: Idle polecats are preserved for reuse. Their sandbox contains\na pre-configured worktree that saves clone time on the next sling. Only\nescalate when there's actual dirty state at risk.\n\n**Step 4: Decide action**\n\n| Observation | Action |\n|-------------|--------|\n| agent_state=running, session alive, recent activity | None |\n| agent_state=running, session alive, idle 5-15 min | Gentle nudge |\n| agent_state=running, session alive, idle 15+ min | Direct nudge with deadline |\n| agent_state=running, SESSION DEAD | ZOMBIE — handle in Step 2a |\n| agent_state=stuck | Assess and help or escalate |\n| agent_state=done | Verify cleanup triggered (see Step 4a) |\n\n**Step 4a: Handle agent_state=done**\n\nIn the persistent model, polecats with agent_state=done should be idle with\ntheir sandbox preserved. Finding one here indicates:\n\n1. **Stale agent bead** - polecat was nuked but bead remains\n   ```bash\n   # Verify polecat doesn't exist anymore\n   ls polecats/\u003cname\u003e 2\u003e/dev/null || echo \"Already nuked\"\n   ```\n   If nuked, the agent bead is stale. Clean it up or ignore.\n\n2. **Cleanup wisp exists** - polecat has dirty state needing intervention\n   ```bash\n   bd list --label polecat:\u003cname\u003e --status=open\n   ```\n   Process in process-cleanups step.\n\n3. **No wisp, polecat exists** - POLECAT_DONE mail was missed\n   Check for pending MR before taking any action:\n   ```bash\n   # Check for pending MR (gt-6a9d: do NOT nuke if MR pending)\n   bd list --label polecat:\u003cname\u003e,state:merge-requested --status=open\n   # If no pending MR and no dirty state → polecat is idle, leave it\n   ```\n   If dirty state exists, create cleanup wisp for investigation.\n\n**Step 5: Execute nudges**\n```bash\n# Use --mode=queue to avoid interrupting in-flight tool calls\ngt nudge --mode=queue \u003crig\u003e/polecats/\u003cname\u003e \"How's progress? Need help?\"\n```\n\n**Step 6: Escalate if needed**\n```bash\ngt mail send deacon/ -s \"Escalation: \u003cpolecat\u003e stuck\" \\\n  -m \"Polecat \u003cname\u003e reports stuck. Please intervene.\"\n```\n\n**Parallelism**: Use Task tool subagents to inspect multiple polecats concurrently.\n\n**ZFC Principle**: Trust agent_state from beads for WHAT agents report. But\nverify tmux session existence for WHETHER agents are alive. A dead session with\nagent_state=running is a zombie — the agent cannot correct its own state.\n\n**Step 7: ORPHANED BEAD DETECTION — Scan from beads side**\n\n🚨 **CRITICAL**: Zombie detection (Step 2a) scans FROM polecat directories.\nOnce a polecat is nuked and its directory removed, its beads become invisible\nto zombie detection. Orphaned bead detection scans FROM beads to catch this case.\n\n```bash\nbd list --status=in_progress --json --limit=0\nbd list --status=hooked --json --limit=0\n```\n\nFor each in_progress or hooked bead with a polecat assignee (format: `\u003crig\u003e/polecats/\u003cname\u003e`):\n0. Verify bead status is still in_progress/hooked (not closed since listing). If\n   closed, skip — the polecat completed its work. (gt-sy8)\n1. Only check beads assigned to polecats in YOUR rig\n2. Check tmux session: `gt session status \u003crig\u003e/\u003cname\u003e --json | jq -r '.running'`\n3. Check polecat directory: `ls \u003crig\u003e/polecats/\u003cname\u003e 2\u003e/dev/null`\n4. If BOTH session dead AND directory missing → orphan. Reset the bead:\n   ```bash\n   bd update \u003cbead-id\u003e --status=open --assignee=\n   gt mail send deacon/ -s \"ORPHAN_RECOVERED: \u003cbead-id\u003e\" \\\n     -m \"Bead \u003cbead-id\u003e was assigned to \u003crig\u003e/polecats/\u003cname\u003e which no longer exists.\n   The bead has been reset to open with no assignee.\n   Please re-dispatch to an available polecat.\"\n   ```\n5.

Its sandbox is\npreserved for reuse by future slings (persistent polecat model, gt-4ac).\n\n⚠️ **Do NOT nuke idle polecats.** Their sandbox is preserved for reuse.\nNuking would force a full re-clone on the next sling, which is slow.\n\nCheck for pending MRs — an idle polecat may have work in the refinery:\n```bash\n# Check for cleanup wisps (merge-requested = MR pending in refinery)\nbd list --label polecat:\u003cname\u003e,state:merge-requested --status=open\n```\nIf a merge-requested wisp exists, the polecat's MR is in the refinery queue.\nDo NOT nuke — the refinery needs the remote branch.\n\n**If dirty** (uncommitted or unpushed work):\n```bash\n# Escalate to Deacon - polecat has work that might be valuable\ngt mail send deacon/ -s \\\"IDLE_DIRTY: \u003cpolecat\u003e has uncommitted work\\\" \\\n  -m \\\"Polecat: \u003cname\u003e\nState: idle (no hook_bead)\nGit status: \u003cuncommitted-files\u003e\nUnpushed commits: \u003ccount\u003e\n\nPlease advise: recover work or discard?\\\"\n```\n\n**Rationale**: Idle polecats are preserved for reuse. Their sandbox contains\na pre-configured worktree that saves clone time on the next sling. Only\nescalate when there's actual dirty state at risk.\n\n**Step 4: Decide action**\n\n| Observation | Action |\n|-------------|--------|\n| agent_state=running, session alive, recent activity | None |\n| agent_state=running, session alive, idle 5-15 min | Gentle nudge |\n| agent_state=running, session alive, idle 15+ min | Direct nudge with deadline |\n| agent_state=running, SESSION DEAD | ZOMBIE — handle in Step 2a |\n| agent_state=stuck | Assess and help or escalate |\n| agent_state=done | Verify cleanup triggered (see Step 4a) |\n\n**Step 4a: Handle agent_state=done**\n\nIn the persistent model, polecats with agent_state=done should be idle with\ntheir sandbox preserved. Finding one here indicates:\n\n1. **Stale agent bead** - polecat was nuked but bead remains\n   ```bash\n   # Verify polecat doesn't exist anymore\n   ls polecats/\u003cname\u003e 2\u003e/dev/null || echo \"Already nuked\"\n   ```\n   If nuked, the agent bead is stale. Clean it up or ignore.\n\n2. **Cleanup wisp exists** - polecat has dirty state needing intervention\n   ```bash\n   bd list --label polecat:\u003cname\u003e --status=open\n   ```\n   Process in process-cleanups step.\n\n3. **No wisp, polecat exists** - POLECAT_DONE mail was missed\n   Check for pending MR before taking any action:\n   ```bash\n   # Check for pending MR (gt-6a9d: do NOT nuke if MR pending)\n   bd list --label polecat:\u003cname\u003e,state:merge-requested --status=open\n   # If no pending MR and no dirty state → polecat is idle, leave it\n   ```\n   If dirty state exists, create cleanup wisp for investigation.\n\n**Step 5: Execute nudges**\n```bash\n# Use --mode=queue to avoid interrupting in-flight tool calls\ngt nudge --mode=queue \u003crig\u003e/polecats/\u003cname\u003e \"How's progress? Need help?\"\n```\n\n**Step 6: Escalate if needed**\n```bash\ngt mail send deacon/ -s \"Escalation: \u003cpolecat\u003e stuck\" \\\n  -m \"Polecat \u003cname\u003e reports stuck. Please intervene.\"\n```\n\n**Parallelism**: Use Task tool subagents to inspect multiple polecats concurrently.\n\n**ZFC Principle**: Trust agent_state from beads for WHAT agents report. But\nverify tmux session existence for WHETHER agents are alive. A dead session with\nagent_state=running is a zombie — the agent cannot correct its own state.\n\n**Step 7: ORPHANED BEAD DETECTION — Scan from beads side**\n\n🚨 **CRITICAL**: Zombie detection (Step 2a) scans FROM polecat directories.\nOnce a polecat is nuked and its directory removed, its beads become invisible\nto zombie detection. Orphaned bead detection scans FROM beads to catch this case.\n\n```bash\nbd list --status=in_progress --json --limit=0\nbd list --status=hooked --json --limit=0\n```\n\nFor each in_progress or hooked bead with a polecat assignee (format: `\u003crig\u003e/polecats/\u003cname\u003e`):\n0. Verify bead status is still in_progress/hooked (not closed since listing). If\n   closed, skip — the polecat completed its work. (gt-sy8)\n1. Only check beads assigned to polecats in YOUR rig\n2. Check tmux session: `gt session status \u003crig\u003e/\u003cname\u003e --json | jq -r '.running'`\n3. Check polecat directory: `ls \u003crig\u003e/polecats/\u003cname\u003e 2\u003e/dev/null`\n4. If BOTH session dead AND directory missing → orphan. Reset the bead:\n   ```bash\n   bd update \u003cbead-id\u003e --status=open --assignee=\n   gt mail send deacon/ -s \"ORPHAN_RECOVERED: \u003cbead-id\u003e\" \\\n     -m \"Bead \u003cbead-id\u003e was assigned to \u003crig\u003e/polecats/\u003cname\u003e which no longer exists.\n   The bead has been reset to open with no assignee.\n   Please re-dispatch to an available polecat.\"\n   ```\n5.

Steps contain **Config:** values that override default behavior.\nIf a config says to skip, you skip. If it specifies a command, you use that\nexact command — not your own assumption. Do NOT guess what a step requires\nbased on the step title or your role knowledge. The step description is the\nsource of truth.\n\n## Variables\n\n| Variable | Default | Description |\n|----------|---------|-------------|\n| wisp_type | patrol | Type of wisp created for this molecule |\n| integration_branch_refinery_enabled | true | Whether refinery merges to integration branches |\n| integration_branch_auto_land | false | Whether to auto-land integration branches when epic children all closed |\n| run_tests | true | Whether to run tests before merging |\n| setup_command | (empty) | Setup/install command (e.g., `pnpm install`). Empty = skip. |\n| typecheck_command | (empty) | Type check command (e.g., `tsc --noEmit`). Empty = skip. |\n| lint_command | (empty) | Lint command (e.g., `eslint .`). Empty = skip. |\n| test_command | go test ./... | Test command to run (if run_tests is true) |\n| build_command | (empty) | Build command (e.g., `go build ./...`). Empty = skip. |\n| target_branch | main | Default target branch for merges |\n| delete_merged_branches | true | Whether to delete source branches after merge |\n\n## Target Resolution Rule\n\nWhen instructions reference `\u003crebase-target\u003e`, `\u003cmerge-target\u003e`, or `\u003cverification-target\u003e`,\nresolve that placeholder with this rule:\n\n- If integration_branch_refinery_enabled = \"true\": use MR target when present, otherwise main.\n- If integration_branch_refinery_enabled = \"false\": always use main.\n\n## FORBIDDEN Actions\n\n- FORBIDDEN: Landing integration branches to the default branch via raw git commands (`git merge`, `git push`).\n  Integration branches may ONLY be landed via `gt mq integration land \u003cepic-id\u003e`.\n  This applies regardless of `auto_land` configuration. The pre-push hook enforces this.\n\n## Step Execution Order\n\nYou MUST process steps in strict DAG order.

IMMEDIATELY verify:\n```bash\ngit fetch origin\nLOCAL_SHA=$(git rev-parse \u003cmerge-target\u003e)\nREMOTE_SHA=$(git rev-parse origin/\u003cmerge-target\u003e)\necho \"Local:  $LOCAL_SHA\"\necho \"Remote: $REMOTE_SHA\"\n```\n\n**If SHAs match**: Push succeeded. Continue to Step 2.\n\n**If SHAs differ**: STOP. Push failed silently.\n- DO NOT send MERGED notification\n- DO NOT close MR bead\n- DO NOT delete branch\n- Debug the push failure (check `git push` output, network, auth)\n- Retry push and verify again before proceeding\n\n⚠️ **STOP HERE - DO NOT PROCEED UNTIL STEPS 1.5 AND 2-3 COMPLETE**\n\n**Step 2: Send MERGED Notification (REQUIRED - DO THIS IMMEDIATELY)**\n\nRIGHT NOW, before any cleanup, send MERGED mail to Witness:\n\n```bash\ngt mail send \u003crig\u003e/witness -s \"MERGED \u003cpolecat-name\u003e\" -m \"Branch: \u003cbranch\u003e\nIssue: \u003cissue-id\u003e\nMerged-At: $(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)\"\n```\n\nThis signals the Witness to nuke the polecat worktree. WITHOUT THIS NOTIFICATION,\nPOLECAT WORKTREES ACCUMULATE INDEFINITELY AND THE LIFECYCLE BREAKS.\n\n**Step 3: Close MR Bead (REQUIRED - DO THIS IMMEDIATELY)**\n\n⚠️ **VERIFICATION BEFORE CLOSING**: Confirm the work is actually on the merge target:\n```bash\n# Get the commit message/issue from the branch\ngit log origin/\u003cmerge-target\u003e --oneline | grep \"\u003cissue-id\u003e\"\n# OR verify the commit SHA is on the target:\ngit branch --contains \u003ccommit-sha\u003e | grep \u003cmerge-target\u003e\n```\n\nIf work is NOT on the merge target, DO NOT close the MR bead.

If source_issue contains a branch name, flag for investigation.\n\n**Step 3.5: Close source issue (REQUIRED)**\n\nThe source issue is the original work bead that the polecat was assigned. Closing it\nsignals convoy completion — without this, the convoy stays open indefinitely and the\nMayor is never notified. This mirrors the Go Engineer behavior (engineer.go:896-904).\n\n```bash\n# The source issue ID was in the MERGE_READY message body (Issue: \u003cid\u003e)\n# You tracked it during inbox-check\nbd close \u003csource-issue-id\u003e --reason \"Merged in \u003cmr-bead-id\u003e\"\n```\n\n**If the source issue ID is not available** from your tracked data, extract it from the MR bead:\n```bash\nbd show \u003cmr-bead-id\u003e --json | jq -r '.[0].source_issue'\n```\n\n**VALIDATION**: Verify the close succeeded:\n```bash\nbd show \u003csource-issue-id\u003e --json | jq -r '.[0].status'\n# Must show \"closed\"\n```\n\nIf close fails, log the warning but continue — do not block the rest of the pipeline.\n\n**Step 4: Archive the MERGE_READY mail (REQUIRED)**\n```bash\ngt mail archive \u003cmerge-ready-message-id\u003e\n```\nThe message ID was tracked when you processed inbox-check.\n\n**Step 5: Cleanup (only after Steps 2-4 confirmed)**\n```bash\ngit branch -d temp\n```\n\ndelete_merged_branches (see config above) controls whether to delete the remote source branch.\n\nIf delete_merged_branches is \"true\":\n```bash\ngit push origin --delete \u003cpolecat-branch\u003e\n```\n\nIf delete_merged_branches is \"false\": Leave the remote branch intact.\n\n**VERIFICATION GATE**: You CANNOT proceed to loop-check without:\n- [x] MERGED mail sent to witness\n- [x] MR bead closed\n- [x] Source issue closed\n- [x] MERGE_READY mail archived\n\nIf you skipped notifications or archiving, GO BACK AND DO THEM NOW.\n\nTarget branch has moved.

The source branch may have been deleted while the MR bead is still open.\n  These likely need to be closed or investigated.\n\n- **Queue depth**: A large number of unclaimed MRs may indicate the refinery is down\n  or overwhelmed. Consider waking it or escalating.\n\n**Step 3: Check deacon health**\n\n⚠️ **The deacon tmux session is named `hq-deacon`** (NOT `deacon`).\nTown-level agents use the `hq-` prefix.\n\n```bash\ntmux has-session -t hq-deacon 2\u003e/dev/null \u0026\u0026 echo \"alive\" || echo \"dead\"\n```\n\nIf the deacon session is dead, escalate to Mayor:\n```bash\ngt mail send mayor/ -s \"ALERT: Deacon session hq-deacon is down\" \\\n  -m \"Deacon tmux session (hq-deacon) not found.\nDetected during witness patrol.\nPlease restart the deacon.\"\n```\n\n**Step 4: Escalate if needed**\n\nIf you identify problems, escalate to Deacon with specific MR IDs and context:\n```bash\ngt mail send deacon/ -s \"QUEUE_HEALTH: \u003csummary\u003e\" \\\n  -m \"MR IDs: \u003cids\u003e\nObservation: \u003cwhat you found\u003e\nRecommendation: \u003cwhat should happen\u003e\"\n```","design":"","due_at":null,"ephemeral":1,"estimated_minutes":null,"event_kind":"","external_ref":null,"hook_bead":"","id":"gt-wisp-zru7r","is_template":0,"issue_type":"task","last_activity":null,"metadata":"{}","mol_type":"","notes":"","original_size":null,"owner":"","payload":"","pinned":0,"priority":2,"quality_score":null,"rig":"","role_bead":"","role_type":"","sender":"","source_repo":"","source_system":"","spec_id":"","status":"closed","target":"","timeout_ns":0,"title":"Check refinery and deacon health","updated_at":"2026-02-27T17:12:24Z","waiters":"","wisp_type":"","work_type":""}
