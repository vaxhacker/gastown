If CLAUDE.md was added or modified on main after the branch point, the polecat never gets it.\n\nFix options:\n1. **gt sling post-spawn hook**: After creating worktree, verify CLAUDE.md exists and has expected content (beads integration section). If missing/stale, pull from main.\n2. **Worktree creation always rebases on main**: gt sling already does this but beads backup conflicts can cause the rebase to fail silently, leaving the worktree on an old commit.\n3. **Session start pre-check**: Before starting the agent session, verify critical files exist (CLAUDE.md, AGENTS.md, CIRCLEMUD.md). Fail fast with clear error if missing.\n4. **.beads/backup/ should be in .gitignore**: These files cause constant rebase conflicts and have zero value in polecat worktrees. Ignoring them would eliminate 90% of rebase failures.\n\nThe .beads/backup conflict issue is the deeper problem — every rebase hits it and polecats either skip the commit (losing real changes) or get stuck.","design":"","due_at":null,"ephemeral":0,"estimated_minutes":null,"event_kind":"","external_ref":null,"hook_bead":"","id":"gt-rre","is_template":0,"issue_type":"bug","last_activity":null,"metadata":"{}","mol_type":"","notes":"","original_size":null,"owner":"shane.werner@gmail.com","payload":"","pinned":0,"priority":1,"quality_score":null,"rig":"","role_bead":"","role_type":"","sender":"","source_repo":"","source_system":"","spec_id":"","status":"open","target":"","timeout_ns":0,"title":"Polecat spawn: ensure CLAUDE.md present in worktree before session start","updated_at":"2026-02-28T00:58:28Z","waiters":"","wisp_type":"","work_type":""}
