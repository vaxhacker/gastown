Currently it's a spin-up/spin-down tool the mayor manually deploys — it should be more integrated. Changes needed: (1) MAIL: Librarian needs its own mailbox (gt mail send/receive as \u003crig\u003e/librarian). It should be able to receive task requests via mail from mayor, witnesses, and refineries, and send status updates/findings back. (2) MAYOR AWARENESS: Update mayor's context/prompts so the mayor proactively thinks about deploying the librarian — after big polecat batches land, when docs drift is suspected, when beads pile up with doc labels, after incidents. Mayor should know how to nudge the librarian with specific tasks rather than generic 'audit everything'. (3) ACTIVE PARTICIPATION: Librarian should be able to file beads for doc issues it discovers, send mail alerts when it finds stale/contradictory docs, and participate in the wisp compaction cycle by flagging doc-related wisps. (4) Consider making librarian a patrol-capable agent (like witness) rather than pure on-demand, with a lightweight doc-drift detection cycle.","design":"","due_at":null,"ephemeral":0,"estimated_minutes":null,"event_kind":"","external_ref":null,"hook_bead":"","id":"gt-bis","is_template":0,"issue_type":"feature","last_activity":null,"metadata":"{}","mol_type":"","notes":"","original_size":null,"owner":"shane.werner@gmail.com","payload":"","pinned":0,"priority":2,"quality_score":null,"rig":"","role_bead":"","role_type":"","sender":"","source_repo":"","source_system":"","spec_id":"","status":"open","target":"","timeout_ns":0,"title":"Librarian: mail integration + mayor awareness + active participation","updated_at":"2026-02-27T20:49:02Z","waiters":"","wisp_type":"","work_type":""}
