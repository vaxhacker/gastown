Check: correct --root-only flag usage, formula attachment logic, beadFieldUpdates correctness, no regressions in sling dispatch flow.","design":"## Code Review: b8f79dc8 — root-only wisps for formula-based work\n\n**Reviewer:** furiosa | **Verdict: LGTM — no issues found**\n\n### 1. --root-only flag usage ✅\n- Applied in both formula instantiation paths: `sling_formula.go:152` (standalone) and `sling_helpers.go:InstantiateFormulaOnBead()` (formula-on-bead)\n- Both add `--root-only` before `--json` in `bd mol wisp` args\n- Ensures all paths create only root wisp, no child step wisps\n\n### 2. Formula attachment logic ✅\n- `AttachedFormula` field added to `beads.AttachmentFields` struct\n- Parsing handles 3 variants (attached_formula/attached-formula/attachedformula) — consistent with existing patterns\n- Formatting, SetAttachmentFields known-fields map both updated correctly\n\n### 3. beadFieldUpdates correctness ✅\n- **sling.go:872**: Sets both AttachedMolecule + AttachedFormula — correct (hook bead has separate wisp)\n- **sling_dispatch.go:308**: Same pattern via params.FormulaName — correct\n- **sling_formula.go:196-199**: Sets ONLY AttachedFormula, omits AttachedMolecule — correct and well-documented (wisp IS the root, self-reference meaningless)\n- `storeFieldsInBead()`: empty-check guard pattern matches existing fields\n\n### 4. No regressions in sling dispatch flow ✅\n- Changes purely additive — no fields removed/reordered\n- Legacy fallback preserved in prime output for beads without AttachedFormula\n\n### 5. Prime output changes ✅\n- `outputAutonomousDirective`: molecule → formula language update\n- `outputMoleculeWorkflow`: branches on AttachedFormula → showFormulaStepsFull() (new), else legacy showMoleculeExecutionPrompt()\n- `outputAttachmentStatus`: same branching pattern\n- `showPatrolFormulaSteps` → `showFormulaSteps`: clean generalization with label param\n- New `showFormulaStepsFull`: renders full step descriptions for work formulas\n\n### 6. Dead code removal ✅\n- `parseMoleculeMetadata()`, `showMoleculeProgress()`: removed (only used for child-step tracking)\n- `outputMoleculeContext()` body gutted for polecats (stub remains — patrol roles dispatch to own functions)\n- `beads` import correctly removed from prime_molecule.go\n- Build verified clean: `go build ./...` passes\n\n### 7. Companion docs commit (470b653e) ✅\n- All role templates (polecat, deacon, witness, refinery) updated\n- Concepts docs and reference updated to match new architecture\n\n### Build verification\n`go build ./...` passes with no errors or warnings.\n\n### Summary\nWell-structured change. The two-path design (formula-on-bead vs standalone-formula) correctly handles AttachedFormula in each context. Legacy fallback ensures backward compat for pre-existing beads. Dead code removal is safe — no orphaned functions or imports. Impact claim of ~15x wisp reduction is architecturally sound (10 child wisps eliminated per polecat sling).","due_at":null,"ephemeral":0,"estimated_minutes":null,"event_kind":"","external_ref":null,"hook_bead":"","id":"gt-8v0f","is_template":0,"issue_type":"task","last_activity":null,"metadata":"{}","mol_type":"","notes":"Review complete.

Preserves human as git author (CV credit flows correctly)\n2. Agent attribution via Co-Authored-By (grep-able for `gt trail`)\n3. Aligns with existing Claude Code Co-Authored-By pattern\n4. Model attribution remains (already in use)\n\n## Agent Email Convention\n\nFor the Co-Authored-By email, use pattern:\n```\n{name}@{role}.{rig}.gastown.local\n\nExamples:\n- jack@crew.gastown.local           # Crew member jack on rig gastown\n- toast@polecats.beads.gastown.local # Polecat toast on rig beads\n- witness@gastown.gastown.local     # Witness on rig gastown (no name)\n- refinery@beads.gastown.local      # Refinery on rig beads\n- mayor@hq.gastown.local            # Mayor (town-level, use \"hq\" as pseudo-rig)\n- deacon@hq.gastown.local           # Deacon (town-level)\n```\n\nPattern breakdown: `{name}@{role}.{rig}.gastown.local`\n- Name: Agent name (or role name if singleton like witness)\n- Role: crew, polecats, witness, refinery, mayor, deacon\n- Rig: The rig name (or \"hq\" for town-level agents)\n- Domain: `gastown.local` (non-routable, clearly synthetic)\n\n## Implementation\n\n### 1. Set agent git identity at spawn time\n\nIn `gt crew spawn` and `gt polecat spawn`:\n```bash\ngit config user.name \"{name} ({role})\"\ngit config user.email \"{name}@{role}.{rig}.gastown.local\"\n```\n\nBut this would make agent the primary author. Instead:\n\n### 2. Use commit hooks or templates\n\nOption A: Commit message template that includes Co-Authored-By\nOption B: Git commit hook that appends Co-Authored-By\nOption C: Agent's commit wrapper adds the line\n\nRecommended: Option C - agents use a `gt commit` wrapper that:\n1. Uses human's git config for author\n2. Appends agent Co-Authored-By line\n3. Appends model Co-Authored-By line (if not present)\n\n### 3. For gt trail: Parse commits\n\n```go\nfunc GetAgentCommits(agentID string) []Commit {\n    // Convert agent ID to email pattern\n    // gastown/crew/jack -\u003e jack@crew.gastown.gastown.local\n    email := AgentIDToEmail(agentID)\n\n    // Search commits for Co-Authored-By matching email\n    return git.LogWithCoAuthor(email)\n}\n```\n\n## How gt trail Uses This\n\n```\ngt trail commits\n```\n\n1. Get current agent identity via `GetRole()` -\u003e `gastown/crew/jack`\n2. Convert to email pattern: `jack@crew.gastown.gastown.local`\n3. Search git log for commits with matching Co-Authored-By\n4. Display results\n\n## Beads Already Handle This\n\nBeads have `created_by` field with agent identity - no change needed there.\n\n## Open Question\n\nShould there be a `gt commit` wrapper, or should this be done via:\n- Git hooks installed by `gt init`?\n- Environment setup at agent spawn?\n- Claude Code configuration?\n\nRecommendation: Git hooks installed per-agent that append the Co-Authored-By line.\n\n## Related\n\n- Blocks: gt-j1m5v (gt trail design)\n- Aligns with: FEDERATION.md identity hierarchy\n- Aligns with: BEADS-SCHEMA-CHANGES.md owner vs created_by\n","design":"","due_at":null,"ephemeral":0,"estimated_minutes":null,"event_kind":"","external_ref":null,"hook_bead":"","id":"gt-f6mkz","is_template":0,"issue_type":"task","last_activity":null,"metadata":"{}","mol_type":"","notes":"","original_size":null,"owner":"steve.yegge@gmail.com","payload":"","pinned":0,"priority":2,"quality_score":null,"rig":"","role_bead":"","role_type":"","sender":"","source_repo":"","source_system":"","spec_id":"","status":"closed","target":"","timeout_ns":0,"title":"Agent git identity: Co-Authored-By convention","updated_at":"2026-02-27T02:56:05Z","waiters":"","wisp_type":"","work_type":""}

Current state:\n- Hooks manually copied to each settings.json\n- No central registry of available hooks\n- No tooling to reconcile reality vs desired state\n- Shell script hooks (like Joe's) not integrated with gt tap\n\n## Critical Discovery: Claude Code Settings Model\n\n**Claude Code does NOT traverse parent directories.** It only looks in CWD.\n\n### Precedence (highest → lowest)\n1. Enterprise Managed Policy (managed-settings.json) - cannot override\n2. CLI flags\n3. .claude/settings.local.json (personal, gitignored)\n4. .claude/settings.json (project, committed)\n5. ~/.claude/settings.json (user global)\n6. Built-in defaults\n\n### Merging Behavior\n- Arrays (hooks): MERGE across all levels\n- Scalars: Override (higher precedence wins)\n\n### The Monorepo Problem\n```\n~/gt/                           ← No .claude/ here\n├── gastown/\n│   └── mayor/\n│       └── .claude/settings.json   ← Only found if CWD is here\n├── beads/\n│   └── .claude/settings.json       ← Only found if CWD is here\n```\n\nIf CWD is `gastown/mayor/rig` (below .claude), hooks WON'T be found.\n\n### Current Workaround\nSettings files at multiple levels, each worktree gets its own copy.\nThis works because agents start in their designated worktree root.\n\n## Design Requirements\n\n### 1. Hook Registry\nCentral definition of available hooks:\n```yaml\nhooks:\n  guards:\n    pr-workflow:\n      command: gt tap guard pr-workflow\n      matchers:\n        - Bash(gh pr create*)\n        - Bash(git checkout -b*)\n        - Bash(git switch -c*)\n      default: enabled\n      scope: [crew, polecats]\n    \n    force-push:\n      command: gt tap guard force-push\n      matchers: [Bash(*push*--force*)]\n      default: enabled\n      scope: [all]\n\n  audits:\n    git-push:\n      command: gt tap audit git-push\n      hook_type: PostToolUse\n      matchers: [Bash(git push*)]\n```\n\n### 2. Tooling\n- `gt crew add \u003cname\u003e` - sets up worktree WITH correct hooks\n- `gt doctor hooks` - reconcile reality vs registry\n- `gt tap list` - show available hooks\n- `gt tap enable/disable \u003chook\u003e` - per-worktree control\n\n### 3. Private vs Public Hooks\n- settings.json (committed) - team-wide hooks\n- settings.local.json (gitignored) - personal overrides\n- How to handle \"disable this hook for me\"?\n\n### 4. Hook Ordering\nIf multiple hooks match same pattern, what order do they fire?\nClaude merges arrays - need to understand/control order.\n\n### 5. Shell Script Hooks\nJoe's hook is a shell script, not a gt command.\nOptions:\n- Keep both patterns (gt tap AND raw scripts)\n- Wrap scripts: `gt tap run \u003cscript-name\u003e`\n- Registry includes both types\n\n### 6. Feature Request Tracking\nClaude Code #12962: parent directory traversal (like .gitignore)\nUntil that ships, we need the workaround.\n\n## Open Questions\n\n1. Where does the registry live? (gt config? dedicated file?)\n2. How to version/migrate hook configs when registry changes?\n3. Per-worktree disable vs global disable?\n4. Should gt tap commands be standalone or require registry?\n\n## Related\n- ~/gt/docs/HOOKS.md - current hook documentation\n- gt tap guard pr-workflow - first implemented hook\n- Claude Code hooks docs","design":"","due_at":null,"ephemeral":0,"estimated_minutes":null,"event_kind":"","external_ref":null,"hook_bead":"","id":"gt-gow8b","is_template":0,"issue_type":"feature","last_activity":null,"metadata":"{}","mol_type":"","notes":"","original_size":null,"owner":"steve.yegge@gmail.com","payload":"","pinned":0,"priority":1,"quality_score":null,"rig":"","role_bead":"","role_type":"","sender":"","source_repo":"","source_system":"","spec_id":"","status":"closed","target":"","timeout_ns":0,"title":"Design: Claude Code hooks registry and management","updated_at":"2026-02-26T23:29:28Z","waiters":"","wisp_type":"","work_type":""}

SESSION (Claude session) — cycles naturally due to context limits. Independent of identity and sandbox.

Instead:\n- One polecat SESSION per molecule STEP\n- Same sandbox (branch/worktree) persists across sessions\n- Each step: spawn → work → close bead → recycle session\n- Final step: spawn → work → close bead → signal complete → merge → nuke sandbox\n\n## Two Cleanup Stages\n\n| Stage | Trigger | Kills | Survives |\n|-------|---------|-------|----------|\n| Step cleanup | Step bead closed | Session | Branch, worktree, molecule |\n| Molecule cleanup | Merged | Session, branch, worktree | Digest |\n\n## Per-Rig Polecat Channel\n\nNeed a mailing list/queue per rig for session-lifecycle requests:\n- \"Recycle me\" (from polecat)\n- \"Recycle worker X\" (from witness/mayor)\n- \"Spawn for step Y\" (from anyone)\n\nFirst-come-first-served by patrolling agents. Anyone on patrol (Witness, Refinery, Crew, Mayor) can service requests.\n\n## GUPP + Pinned Work = Completion\n\nAs long as:\n1. Work is pinned to polecat identity (e.g., gastown/furiosa)\n2. Sandbox persists (branch + worktree)\n3. Someone keeps spawning polecat when it dies\n\n→ The molecule WILL get finished. GUPP ensures wake-and-work.\n\n## Daemon → Deacon Heartbeat\n\nThe daemon pings the deacon, keeping the cycle alive. Deacon peeks into rig-wide channels during patrol and can service lifecycle requests.\n\n## Open Design Questions\n\n### Q1: Spoon-Feeding Bin-Packing\nTwo dimensions of granularity trade-offs:\n- How many logical steps per physical molecule step?\n- How many molecule steps per polecat session?\n\nToo few steps → context exhaustion, forgetting\nToo many steps → overhead, fragmentation\n\nNeeds: Analysis of optimal granularity based on step complexity.\n\n### Q2: Mechanical vs Agent-Driven Recycling\nCaution from deacon murder spree bug: mechanical detection of \"stuck\" workers is fragile.\n\nPrefer: Explicit \"recycle me\" requests serviced by patrol agents.\n\nQuestion: When is mechanical intervention appropriate?\n\n### Q3: Channel Implementation\nOptions:\n- Mail-based (gt mail to rig/polecats)\n- Beads-based (special issue type)\n- State file (rig/polecat-queue.json)\n\nMail seems most consistent with Gas Town patterns.\n\n### Q4: Who Spawns Next Step?\nCurrent: gt sling spawns fresh polecat\nNeeded: Mechanism for \"continue molecule on existing sandbox\"\n\nMaybe: gt sling --continue or witness detects pending step.\n\n## Related Issues\n\n- gt-dtw9u: Witness monitoring (enhance survey-workers)\n- gt-qpwv4: Completion detection (check ready branches)\n- gt-6qyt1: Refinery queue (process MERGE_READY)\n- gt-budeb: Auto-nuke (handle MERGED signal)\n- gt-5j3ia: Swarm aggregation (batch completion)\n- gt-1dbcp: Polecat auto-start (SessionStart hook issue)\n\n## Design Principles (from HOP/MEOW context)\n\n1. **Discovery over tracking** - observe reality each cycle\n2. **Mail as coordination primitive** - agents signal via mail\n3. **ZFC** - Claude makes judgment calls, no hardcoded thresholds\n4. **Redundant monitoring** - overlapping observation is resilience\n5. **Wisps are ephemeral** - patrol molecules flow like water\n\n## Next Steps\n\n1. Finalize channel design (mail-based queue)\n2. Enhance witness patrol formula with completion detection\n3. Enhance refinery patrol with MERGED signaling\n4. Implement step-level recycling\n5.

AND l.label = 'gt:message'`\n\n### 3. wisps_migrate.go:316,327,337,347 — INNER JOINs without WHERE (bulk migration)\nFour queries all following the same pattern:\n```sql\nINSERT IGNORE INTO wisp_labels (issue_id, label)\nSELECT l.issue_id, l.label FROM labels l INNER JOIN wisps w ON l.issue_id = w.id\n```\n(Same for wisp_comments, wisp_events, wisp_dependencies)\n**Risk**: Full cross-product of labels×wisps (and comments×wisps, events×wisps, deps×wisps). No WHERE clause means all matching rows processed. No LIMIT. Migration runs once, but if wisps table is large, each query processes the entire join.\n**Mitigating factor**: These run only during migration, not in steady state. But could still OOM on large databases.\n**Fix**: Add batching with LIMIT/OFFSET, or add WHERE clause filtering to avoid unnecessary work.\n\n## MODERATE — Should Review\n\n### 4. jsonl_git_backup.go:238 — SELECT * with multiple LIKE patterns\n```sql\nSELECT * FROM `%s`.issues WHERE (ephemeral IS NULL OR ephemeral != 1)\n  AND issue_type NOT IN ('message', 'event', 'agent', 'convoy', 'molecule', 'role', 'merge-request', 'rig')\n  AND id NOT LIKE '%-wisp-%' AND id NOT LIKE '%-cv-%'\n  AND id NOT LIKE 'test%' AND id NOT LIKE 'beads\\_t%'\n  AND id NOT LIKE 'beads\\_pt%' AND id NOT LIKE 'doctest\\_%'\n  AND id NOT LIKE 'offlinebrew-%'\n  AND title NOT LIKE '--%' AND title NOT LIKE 'Usage: %'\n  ORDER BY id\n```\n**Risk**: SELECT * (all columns), 9 LIKE patterns (each requires string comparison), no LIMIT. Full table scan guaranteed. If issues table grows large, this becomes expensive.\n**Mitigating factor**: Runs as daemon backup, not interactive path.\n**Fix**: Add LIMIT with batching for very large tables, or filter by indexed columns first.\n\n### 5. wl_sync.go:99-103 — Four scalar subqueries\n```sql\nSELECT (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM wanted WHERE status = 'open') AS open_wanted,\n       (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM wanted) AS total_wanted,\n       (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM completions) AS total_completions,\n       (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM stamps) AS total_stamps\n```\n**Risk**: Four separate COUNT(*) scans in one query. Dolt may not optimize these well.\n**Mitigating factor**: Runs via `dolt sql` CLI, not the shared server. Tables are small (wasteland).\n**Fix**: Low priority since it runs locally, but could use 4 separate queries or UNION.\n\n### 6. compactor_dog.go — ORDER BY on dolt_log\n```sql\nSELECT commit_hash FROM `%s`.dolt_log ORDER BY date ASC LIMIT 1  -- root commit\nSELECT commit_hash FROM `%s`.dolt_log ORDER BY date DESC LIMIT 1 -- HEAD commit\n```\n**Risk**: dolt_log can grow unboundedly with commit history. ORDER BY without index could be expensive.\n**Mitigating factor**: LIMIT 1 helps, and Dolt may optimize dolt_log access. HEAD query likely short-circuits.\n\n### 7. beads/store.go:954-960 — Correlated NOT EXISTS subquery\n```sql\nSELECT COUNT(*) FROM dolt_status s\nWHERE NOT EXISTS (\n  SELECT 1 FROM dolt_ignore di WHERE di.ignored = 1 AND s.table_name LIKE di.pattern\n)\n```\n**Risk**: Correlated subquery with LIKE pattern matching. Runs for each row in dolt_status.\n**Mitigating factor**: dolt_status is tiny (handful of rows). Low risk in practice.\n\n## LOW RISK — Acceptable\n\n- **wisp_reaper.go:430** — JOIN with LIMIT (properly batched, good pattern)\n- **health.go:239** — Dynamic WHERE with LIMIT 10 (bounded result set)\n- **vitals.go:151** — Aggregation with CASE (efficient single-pass pattern)\n- **doltserver.go:2154** — COUNT(*) on PROCESSLIST (system table, tiny)\n- **beads/store.go** — Most queries are simple single-table SELECTs, properly parameterized\n\n## Summary Table\n\n| Priority | File | Line | Pattern | Risk |\n|----------|------|------|---------|------|\n| CRITICAL | wisp_reaper.go | 519-535 | 2x NOT IN + INNER JOIN | OOM on large DBs |\n| CRITICAL | wisp_reaper.go | 413 | IN (SELECT subquery) | Hang on large tables |\n| HIGH | wisps_migrate.go | 316,327,337,347 | JOIN without WHERE (×4) | OOM during migration |\n| MEDIUM | jsonl_git_backup.go | 238 | SELECT * + 9 LIKEs, no LIMIT | Slow backup on large DBs |\n| LOW | wl_sync.go | 99-103 | 4 scalar subqueries | Minor, local CLI only |\n| LOW | compactor_dog.go | 135,290,322 | ORDER BY on dolt_log | LIMIT 1 mitigates |\n| LOW | beads/store.go | 954-960 | Correlated NOT EXISTS | dolt_status always tiny |\n\n## Recommendations\n\n1. **Immediate**: Rewrite wisp_reaper.go:519-535 to use LEFT JOIN pattern or pre-filter in Go\n2. **Immediate**: Rewrite wisp_reaper.go:413 to use INNER JOIN instead of IN (SELECT)\n3. **Soon**: Add batching (LIMIT+loop) to wisps_migrate.go bulk INSERT IGNORE queries\n4. **Later**: Add LIMIT+batching to jsonl_git_backup.go backup query for large table resilience","due_at":null,"ephemeral":0,"estimated_minutes":null,"event_kind":"","external_ref":null,"hook_bead":"","id":"gt-u55vt","is_template":0,"issue_type":"task","last_activity":null,"metadata":"{}","mol_type":"","notes":"Audit complete.

But it also needs to PRODUCE work - structured, high-quality guzzoline on demand. **Formula Molecules** are recipes that spawn structured convoys.\n\n## Core Insight\n\nA formula is a molecule template that:\n1. Takes input (a PR, a design problem, a codebase)\n2. Spawns multiple polecats with specific focuses\n3. Each leg produces structured output\n4. Synthesis step combines into unified deliverable\n\nGas Town becomes both consumer AND producer of guzzoline.\n\n## Example Formulas\n\n### Design Convoy Formula\nInput: Feature request or problem statement\nLegs (parallel):\n- API design polecat\n- Data model polecat  \n- UX/ergonomics polecat\n- Scalability polecat\n- Security polecat\nSynthesis: Unified design doc with tradeoffs\n\n### Code Review Convoy Formula\nInput: PR or file set\nLegs (parallel):\n- Correctness: Does it work?\n- Performance: Any bottlenecks?\n- Security: Vulnerabilities?\n- Elegance: Clean design?\n- Resilience: Error handling?\n- Style: Convention compliance?\n- Smells: Anti-patterns?\n- Legacy: Respects existing patterns?\nSynthesis: Categorized review with priority issues\n\n### Other Formula Ideas\n- Test Coverage Convoy: Unit, integration, edge cases, error paths\n- Documentation Convoy: API docs, user guide, examples, changelog\n- Migration Convoy: Database, API, config, rollback plan\n- Incident Response: Root cause, timeline, fix, prevention\n\n## Mol Mall\n\nLibrary/marketplace of formulas:\n```bash\ngt formula list              # Available formulas\ngt formula show code-review  # Formula details\ngt formula run code-review --pr=123  # Execute formula → convoy\ngt formula create my-review  # Create custom formula\n```\n\n## Technical Design\n\n### Formula Structure (in beads)\n```yaml\nid: formula-code-review\ntype: formula\nname: Code Review\ninputs:\n  - name: target\n    type: pr | files | branch\nlegs:\n  - name: correctness\n    focus: \"Verify logical correctness and edge cases\"\n    output: findings.md\n  - name: security\n    focus: \"Identify security vulnerabilities\"\n    output: findings.md\n  # ...\nsynthesis:\n  inputs: all leg outputs\n  output: review-summary.md\n```\n\n### Execution Model\n1. `gt formula run` creates convoy with formula reference\n2. Spawns polecats for each leg (parallel where possible)\n3. Each polecat gets leg-specific prompt + shared context\n4. Outputs collected as bead attachments or slots\n5. Synthesis polecat reads all outputs, produces final deliverable\n6. Convoy lands with unified result\n\n### Dependencies\n- Leg outputs feed synthesis (internal convoy deps)\n- Formula can specify leg ordering if needed\n- Parallel by default, sequential where required\n\n## Open Questions\n\n1. Where do formulas live? Town-level beads? Separate formula registry?\n2. How to version/share formulas across towns?\n3. Leg output format standardization?\n4. Human checkpoints between legs or only at end?\n5. Partial formula runs (skip some legs)?\n6. Formula composition (formula that includes other formulas)?\n\n## Why This Matters\n\nGas Town currently waits for humans to create work.

Monitor workers: Track polecat health and progress\n2. Nudge: Prompt slow workers toward completion\n3. Pre-kill verification: Ensure git state is clean before killing sessions\n4. Session lifecycle: Kill sessions, update worker state\n5. Self-cycling: Hand off to fresh session when context fills\n6. Escalation: Report stuck workers to Mayor\n\nKey principle: You own ALL per-worker cleanup. Mayor is never involved in\nroutine worker management.\n\n## Propulsion Principle\n\nIf you find something on your hook, YOU RUN IT.\n\nYour work is defined by the mol-witness-patrol molecule.

Track nudge count per worker per issue.\n- First Nudge (10+ min idle): Gentle inquiry\n- Second Nudge (15 min): Direct question\n- Third Nudge (20 min): Final warning\nAfter 3 nudges with no progress then escalate to Mayor\n\n## Pre-Kill Verification\n\nBefore killing ANY polecat session:\n1. gt polecat git-state \u003cname\u003e - Must be clean\n2.

New code ignores role beads entirely (reads from config)\n2. Old role beads become orphaned (harmless)\n3. Users can optionally run `bd close hq-*-role` to clean up\n4. Or just leave them (they're inert)\n\nNo data migration required. The config system is additive.\n\n### What Stays the Same\n\n- Agent beads (`hq-deacon`, `gt-gastown-witness`) - Still store runtime state\n- System prompt templates (`internal/templates/roles/*.md.tmpl`) - Unchanged\n- `settings.json` role_agents - Model selection stays in settings\n\n### Benefits\n\n1. **No migration needed** - Config ships with binary\n2. **Clear separation** - Config (how roles work) vs. ledger (work evidence)\n3. **Easy customization** - Edit YAML, not beads\n4. **Versioned with code** - Role defs evolve with releases\n5. **Discoverable** - `gt role show deacon` vs. `bd show hq-deacon-role`\n6. **Aligns with HOP** - Beads are for work, not infrastructure\n\n## Implementation Plan\n\n### Phase 1: Add config system (non-breaking)\n- [ ] Create `internal/config/roles.go` with types\n- [ ] Create embedded default YAML files\n- [ ] Add `LoadRoleConfig()` function\n- [ ] Add `gt role show` and `gt role list` commands\n\n### Phase 2: Switch daemon to config\n- [ ] Update `daemon/lifecycle.go` to use `LoadRoleConfig()`\n- [ ] Update `getRoleConfigForIdentity()` to use new loader\n- [ ] Test all role types still work\n\n### Phase 3: Clean up role beads\n- [ ] Remove role bead creation from `gt install`\n- [ ] Remove `gt migrate-agents` command\n- [ ] Update `gt doctor` to check config instead of role beads\n- [ ] Remove `role_bead` field from agent bead schema\n- [ ] Mark `beads_role.go` as deprecated (or remove)\n\n### Phase 4: Documentation\n- [ ] Update architecture.md\n- [ ] Add role customization docs\n- [ ] Update PRIMING.md if needed\n\n## Open Questions\n\n1. **Should defaults be written to disk?** Current design embeds in binary. Alternative: `gt install` writes `roles/defaults/` as reference copies.\n\n2. **Rig-level role overrides path?** Currently `\u003crig\u003e/roles/`. Could also be `\u003crig\u003e/config/roles/` for consistency.\n\n3. **Role inheritance?** Should `crew` be able to inherit from `polecat` with overrides? (Probably not - keep it simple.)\n\n## References\n\n- PRIMING.md - Two-level beads architecture\n- architecture.md - Agent bead storage\n- 001-beads-is-the-ledger.md - Beads as work ledger, not config store\n","design":"","due_at":null,"ephemeral":0,"estimated_minutes":null,"event_kind":"","external_ref":null,"hook_bead":"","id":"gt-y1uvb","is_template":0,"issue_type":"epic","last_activity":null,"metadata":"{}","mol_type":"","notes":"","original_size":null,"owner":"steve.yegge@gmail.com","payload":"","pinned":0,"priority":2,"quality_score":null,"rig":"","role_bead":"","role_type":"","sender":"","source_repo":"","source_system":"","spec_id":"","status":"closed","target":"","timeout_ns":0,"title":"Replace role beads with config-based role system","updated_at":"2026-02-27T02:56:07Z","waiters":"","wisp_type":"","work_type":""}
