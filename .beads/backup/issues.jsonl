Steps contain **Config:** values that override default behavior.\nIf a config says to skip, you skip. If it specifies a command, you use that\nexact command — not your own assumption. Do NOT guess what a step requires\nbased on the step title or your role knowledge. The step description is the\nsource of truth.\n\n## Variables\n\n| Variable | Default | Description |\n|----------|---------|-------------|\n| wisp_type | patrol | Type of wisp created for this molecule |\n| integration_branch_refinery_enabled | true | Whether refinery merges to integration branches |\n| integration_branch_auto_land | false | Whether to auto-land integration branches when epic children all closed |\n| run_tests | true | Whether to run tests before merging |\n| setup_command | (empty) | Setup/install command (e.g., `pnpm install`). Empty = skip. |\n| typecheck_command | (empty) | Type check command (e.g., `tsc --noEmit`). Empty = skip. |\n| lint_command | (empty) | Lint command (e.g., `eslint .`). Empty = skip. |\n| test_command | go test ./... | Test command to run (if run_tests is true) |\n| build_command | (empty) | Build command (e.g., `go build ./...`). Empty = skip. |\n| target_branch | main | Default target branch for merges |\n| delete_merged_branches | true | Whether to delete source branches after merge |\n\n## Target Resolution Rule\n\nWhen instructions reference `\u003crebase-target\u003e`, `\u003cmerge-target\u003e`, or `\u003cverification-target\u003e`,\nresolve that placeholder with this rule:\n\n- If integration_branch_refinery_enabled = \"true\": use MR target when present, otherwise main.\n- If integration_branch_refinery_enabled = \"false\": always use main.\n\n## FORBIDDEN Actions\n\n- FORBIDDEN: Landing integration branches to the default branch via raw git commands (`git merge`, `git push`).\n  Integration branches may ONLY be landed via `gt mq integration land \u003cepic-id\u003e`.\n  This applies regardless of `auto_land` configuration. The pre-push hook enforces this.\n\n## Step Execution Order\n\nYou MUST process steps in strict DAG order. Walk through each step sequentially,\nunless you are explicitly told to skip to a step.","design":"","due_at":null,"ephemeral":1,"estimated_minutes":null,"event_kind":"","external_ref":null,"hook_bead":"","id":"gt-wisp-k5uz","is_template":0,"issue_type":"epic","last_activity":null,"metadata":"{}","mol_type":"","notes":"","original_size":null,"owner":"","payload":"","pinned":0,"priority":2,"quality_score":null,"rig":"","role_bead":"","role_type":"","sender":"","source_repo":"","source_system":"","spec_id":"","status":"hooked","target":"","timeout_ns":0,"title":"mol-refinery-patrol","updated_at":"2026-02-27T22:18:03Z","waiters":"","wisp_type":"","work_type":""}
